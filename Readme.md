# To Do list:

## Writing

- [ ] add discussion of relationship between our model and Poisson/Hawkes processes

- [ ] discuss pipeline to recover top cables for an event

- [ ] add in exploratory results (figures + discussion)

- [X] take a pass through document to ensure everything is up to date with current model


## Results

- [ ] pinpoint a measure of "eventness" and make plots of events over time

- [ ]  compute held out log lieklihood for full model, event only, and entity only.  (on cables data; just waiting for fits to finish)

- [ ] simulations: show that our model outperforms baselines on detecting "eventness," recovering relevant documents, or preferably both

- [ ] model update: include entity-specific parameter (implement, test, and kick off new fits)

- [ ] curate data and kick off fits to arXiv and Enron; should do {full, events only, entity only} on these and compute heldout LL
