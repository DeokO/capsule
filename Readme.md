# To Do list:

## After Submission

- [ ] Investigate daily model of cables ***

- [X] stochastic inference ***

- [X] limit exponential decay for events ***

- [X] figure out issue of held out log likelihood on cables (event only does better than full) ***

- [ ] explore alternative measure of eventness, possibly using pi

- [ ] find cables that come after the given time interval, but are still related to the event

- [ ] apply the model to another dataset

- [ ] visualization pipeline ***

- [ ] consider how to incorporate receivers or sender/receiver pairs

- [ ] flush out Poisson process relationship

- [ ] does rate of communication provide information? can this be incorporated into the model?

- [ ] events connected to subsets of entities (and/or multiple events in a single interval)

- [X] bigram or trigram vocabulary *
