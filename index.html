        <h3>Detecting and Characterizing Events</h3>
        <p>Significant events are characterized by interactions between entities 
        (such as countries, organizations, or individuals) that deviate from typical
        interaction patterns. Analysts, including historians, political scientists, 
        and journalists, commonly read large quantities of text to construct an 
        accurate picture of when and where an event happened, who was involved, 
        and in what ways. We present the Capsule model for analyzing 
        documents to detect and characterize events of potential significance.
        Specifically, we develop a model based on topic modeling that distinguishes
        between topics that describe "business as usual" and topics that deviate from
        these patterns.</p>

        <p>A demostration of the model can be found <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~achaney/capsule/">here</a>.</p>
