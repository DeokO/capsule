8.  AIR FRANCE AND FRENCH POLICE, WHO WERE DEBRIEFING
SOME PASSENGERS WHO WANTED TALK, REQUESTED PASSENGERS
NOT TO TALK IN GREAT DETAIL TO NEWS MEDIA.  MANY
REPORTERS AT ARRIVAL HALL THOUGH FEW GOT TO TALK MUCH
WITH PASSENGERS IN CONFUSION OVER ONWARD TICKETS AND
TEMPORARY LODGING, ETC.  MERV GRIFFITH AND ENTOURAGE MET
MURRAY SCHWARTZ AND BOTH TALKED TO PRESS AS DID MRS.
ZEGER.  BASED ON COMMENTS HEARD BY CONOFFS AND IN
VIEW OF AGE AND PHILOSOPHICAL DIFFERENCES AMONG
PASSENGERS THERE MAY BE SEVERAL DIFFERENT AND CONFLICTING
VERSIONS OF HIJACKING IN PRESS.  STATEMENTS MAY INCLUDE
CHARGES THAT FREEDMAN, TAYLOR, AND OTHER YOUNGER
PASSENGERS "SYMPATHETIC" TOWARDS HIJACKERS AND THAT
OLDER PASSENGERS "INTRANSIGENCE" INFLUENCED HIJACKERS TO
SEGREGATE "ISRAELIS."

AND SON-IN-LAW OF MR. GEORGE KARFUNKEL, WERE NOT

DAUGHTER BORN IN BROOKLYN AND SON-IN-LAW BORN IN HUNGARY
BUT HAS BEEN LONG TIME NATURALIZED CITIZEN.  THEY ARE
NOT ISRAELI CITIZENS, BUT MAKING TEN-DAY HOLIDAY VISIT
TO ISRAEL.  ZEGERS DID NOT KNOW WHY THEY WERE INCLUDED
IN ISRAELI GROUP.

1.  WE DO NOT BELIEVE IT ADVISABLE TO TRY TO DEBRIEF
CAPTAIN BACOS OR OTHER MEMBERS OF THE AIR FRANCE CREW
DIRECTLY, AND WE DOUBT THAT THEY WOULD BE PERMITTED TO
DO SO BY AIR FRANCE AND THE GOF.  LE MONDE OF JULY 6
QUOTES THE "MECHANICS OFFICER" OF THE AIRBUS, SPEAKING
IN THE NAME OF THE CREW, AS THANKING PRESIDENT IDI
AMIN DADA "FOR HIS CONSTANT CARE TO ASSURE OUR
SECURITY, OUR MATERIAL COMFORT AND SANITATION".  LE
MONDE OF JULY 7 GIVES THE CAPTAIN'S ACCOUNT IN WHICH HE
SAID HE HAD THE MECHANICS OFFICER READ THE CREW STATE-
MENT BECAUSE HE HAD LOST HIS VOICE.  HE SAID FURTHER,
"THE UGANDAN AUTHORITIES MADE EFFORTS TO ASSURE TO THE
HOSTAGES DECENT MATERIAL CONDITIONS.  IT WAS NOT A
QUESTION OF ANYTHING ELSE".
2.  DEPARTMENT'S ATTENTION DIRECTED TD AFP-093 OF
JULY 7 FROM PARIS WHICH CONTAINS THE HIGHLIGHTS OF A
PRESS CONFERENCE GIVEN THE SAME DAY AT AIR FRANCE
HEADQUARTERS BY BACOS AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE AIRBUS
CREW.  CONCERNING UGANDAN INVDLVEMENT, BACOS SAID THAT
AFTER THE PLANE'S STOP AT BENGHAZI, THE HIJACKERS
INSTRUCTED THE PILOTS TO PREPARE FOR A FLIGHT OF 2000
NAUTICAL MILES, WITHOUT INDICATING DESTINATION.  THE
PILOTS KNEW ONLY ONE AND A HALF HOURS BEFORE THEIR
ARRIVAL THAT KAMPALA WAS THEIR DESTINATION.  BACOS WAS
THEN AUTHORIZED TO MAKE RADIO CONTACT WITH ANOTHER PLANE
IN FLIGHT BELONGING TO EAST AFRICAN AIRLINES TO RE-
CEIVE INFORMATION ON LANDING CONDITION AT ENTEBBE.
THE PLANE LANDED THERE AT 04:30 HOURS LOCAL, AND FOR AN
HOUR, ON INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE CONTROL TOWER, TAXIED
ON THE LANDING STRIP.  "IT APPEARED THAT A CERTAIN CON-
FUSION WAS THE BASIS FOR THE CONTRADICTORY ORDERS
GIVEN BY THE CONTROL TOWER WHICH CAUSED THIS HOUR-LONG
PROMENADE."
3.  BACOS SAID THE PLANE WAS FINALLY AUTHORIZED TO
STOP AT THE END OF THE STRIP.  ABOUT ONE O'CLOCK,
ORDERS WERE GIVEN TO START THE MOTORS AND TO
MOVE THE PIANE NEAR THE OLD TERMINAL ABOUT 500
METERS AWAY.  PRESIDENT AMIN, SURROUNDED BY SOLDIERS,
FM AMEMBASSY PARIS
TO SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 2710
INFO AMEMBASSY TEL AVIV
C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 02 OF 02 PARIS 19752
WAS STANDING BEFORE THE TERMINAL.  TWO MEN, APPARENTLY
PALESTINIANS, HAD THE PASSENGERS DISEMBARK AHD LED
THEM TO THE TERMINAL.
4.  ACCORDING TO THE CREW, CONTINUES THE AFP ITEM,
THREE OTHER PALESTINIANS JOINED THE FOUR PIRATES WHO
HAD HIJACKED THE PLANE AND PARTICIPATED IN GUARDING THE
HOSTAGES.  TWO OTHER MEN, NOT IDENTIFIED BY THE CREW,
WENT BACK AND FORTH BUT DID NOT
PARTICIPATE IN GUARDING.  AT NO TIME DID UGANDAN TROOPS
ENTER THE TERMINAL WAITING ROOM; THEY WERE STATIONED
AT SOME DISTANCE FROM IT AND CONSTITUTED A SORT OF
SECURITY CORDON.  AMIN VISITED THE HOSTAGES SEVERAL
TIMES AND TOLD THEM THAT HE WAS BUSY WORKING FOR THEM
AND HAD MADE CONTACTS WITH DIFFERENT GOVERNMENTS TO
LIBERATE THEM.
5.  COMMENT:  IT SEEMS CLEAR THAT AIR FRANCE AND THE
GOF DO NOT WISH FURTHER TO COMPLICATE THEIR
RELATIONS WITH ARAB COUNTRIES AND PARTICULARLY AMIN
AND WILL THEREFORE DOWNPLAY ANY ASPECT OF CLEAR
LINKAGE OF UGANDANS WITH THE HIJACKERS.  RECOVERY OF
THE PLANE IS NO DOUBT OF HIGHER PRIORITY THAN FURTHER
TESTIMONY SHOWING AMIN'S SUPPORT FDR THE HIJACKERS,
WHICH IS PRETTY GENERALLY ASSUMED HERE WHERE MUCH OF
THE EVIDENCE CITED IN STATE 167345 HAS BEEN REPORTED
BY THE MEDIA.
