1.  THE FRENCH HAVE TOLD THE FRG FOREIGN OFFICE THAT
THE ISRAELIS ARE STILL WILLING TO RELEASE "CERTAIN,
BUT NOT ALL, PRISONERS FOR ALL HOSTAGES" AND ARE
READY TO DISCUSS THE MODALITIES FOR SUCH AN EXCHANGE.
BUT THEY HAVE SAID THAT THEY WILL NOT DELIVER THEIR
PRISONERS TO UGANDA, BECAUSE THE ISRAELIS DO NOT
TRUST AMIN.
2.  KENYA CONTINUES TO DENY THAT IT IS HOLDING ANY
PALESTINIANS.
3.  THE GERMANS UNDERSTAND THAT THE SWISS WILL GO
ALONG WITH WHATEVER THE GERMANS DECIDE.
4.  BUT, ACCORDING TO THE FOREIGN OFFICE ASSISTANT
DIRECTOR FOR EAST AFRICA, THE GERMANS HAVE NOT
REACHED A DECISION.  THE CABINET WILL MEET AT
3:00 PM, JULY 3, IN A FURTHER EFFORT TO RESOLVE
THE DILEMMA.

1. SWISS FOREIGN OFFICE (KAUFFMAN) INFORMS US THAT ISRAELIS HAD
PASSED LIST OF 12-15 IMPRISONED TERRORISTS TO FRENCH GOVT
WHOM THEY WERE PREPARED TO RELEASE IN EXCHANGE FOR RELEASE
OF ISRAELIS IN KAMPALA.
2. KAUFFMAN SAID THAT GOS IS PREPARED TO REMAIN FIRM, BUT
