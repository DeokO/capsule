1. KENYA GOVERNMENT HAS SUSPENDED ALL SCHEDULED AIR SERVICE
BETWEEN NAIROBI AND DAR ES SALAAM (REFTEL). WE ARE DEPENDENT
ON NAIROBI FOR MEDICAL SERVICES, AIRLINE INTERCHANGE POINT, ETC.
ACCORDINGLY REQUEST DEPT ASAP INSTRUCT EMBASSY NAIROBI TO
REQUEST ON BEHALF OF USG FROM KENYA GOVERNMENT PERMISSION TO
ALLOW INTERNATIONAL AIR CARRIERS TO PROVIDE SERVICE BETWEEN DAR
ES SALAAM AND NAIROBI IN THE FOLLOWING SITUATIONS:
A. MEDICAL. NAIROBI IS NEAREST POINT TO DAR ES SALAAM FOR
ADEQUATE MEDICAL SERVICE SHORT OF JOHANNESBURG OR FRANKFURT.
PERMIT USG EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS, AND THEIR DEPENDENTS (USING
DIPLOMATIC, OFFICIAL AND REGULAR PASSPORTS) TO TRAVEL BETWEEN
DAR ES SALAAM AND NAIROBI FOR THE PURPOSE OF MEDICAL TREATMENT.
(MRS. DAVID HALSTED, DEPENDENT OF EMB OFF, NOW IN NAIROBI ON
MEDEVAC ORDERS AWAITING KENYA GOVERNMENT PERMISSION TO RETURN DAR.)
B. DIPLOMATIC COURIER. ALLOW US COURIER OPERATIONS. (COURIER
SERVICE ALREADY INTERRUPTED BY KENYA GOVERNMENT ACTION AS NOTED
FRANKFURT 4267 AND DAR ES SALAAM 2301.)
C. DIPLOMATIC POUCHES AND OTHER CARGO. WE DEPEND ON NAIROBI
FOR SUPPLIES AND AS INTERCHANGE POINT FOR MAIL AND OTHER
NECESSARY CARGO. ALLOW FREE MOVEMENT OF POUCHES AND OTHER
DIPLOMATIC CARGO. (EMBASSY NAIROBI INFORMED US THAT KENYA
GOVERNMENT ON JUNE 3 REFUSED LOADING OF CARGO ON PAN AM 184
MANIFESTED TO US EMBASSY DAR.)
D. TRANSIT. ALLOW USG EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS, AND THEIR
DEPENDENTS TO LEAVE NAIROBI AIRPORT WHILE THEY ARE AWAITING
ONWARD FLIGHT CONNECTIONS.
2. REQUEST DEPT TO CHANGE DAR ES SALAAM R&R POINT FROM ATHENS
TO LONDON. THERE ARE NO DIRECT FLIGHTS BETWEEN HERE AND ATHENS.
LONDON IS THE CITY IN EUROPE WITH WHICH DAR IS CONNECTED BY
LARGEST NUMBER OF DIRECT FLIGHTS, AVOIDING NAIROBI CONNECTION
PROBLEM.
3. ATHENS ALSO NO LONGER PRACTICAL INTERCHANGE POINT WITH US
FLAG CARRIER FOR ONWARD JOURNEYS TO US. WE THEREFORE NOW
ROUTING USG TRAVELLERS FROM DAR TO NEAREST EUROPEAN INTERCHANGE
POINT WHERE WE CAN GET CONFIRMED ONWARD FLIGHTS TO US ON
US FLAG CARRIERS.

1978KUALA08278|1978-08-04|KUALA LUMPUR|STATE|POSSIBLE BILATERAL CONSULATIONS ON TIN
1. DEPARTMENT WILL RECALL THAT SEVERAL MONTHS AGO GOM MINISTER
OF PRIMARY INDUSTRIES, DATUK TAIB HAHMOOD, SUGGESTED THE
DESIRABILITY OF KEEPING OPEN A BILATERAL DIALOGUE ON TIN
ISSUES(REF A). TAIB SEEMED TO BE SAYING THAT MALAYSIA, AS
THE LARGEST TIN PRODUCE AND A RELATIVE MODERATE ON TIN ISSUES,
COULD ACT AS A BRIDGE BETWEEN THE US AND OTHER PRODUCER
COUNTRIES.
2. EVEN THOUGH TAIB HAS NOW BEEN REPLACED BY PAUL LEONG,
FORMERLY DEPUTY MINISTER OF PRIMARY INDUSTRIES, WE WOULD LIKE
TO SUGGEST THAT THE DEPARTMENT GIVE CAREFUL CONSIDERATION TO
FOLLOWING UP ON TAIB'S SUGGESTION, NOW THAT THE ITC HAS
BOTH APPROVED HIGHER FLOOR AND CEILING PRICES(DESPITE OUR
OPPOSITION) AND ENDORSED MEASURES BY PRODUCER AND CONSUMER
COUNTRIES TO "PROMOTE A FURTHER EXPANSION OF THE TIN INDUSTRY."
WE BELIEVE THE LEONG, DESPITE THE NATIONALIST CLOAK HE
WEARS ON SOME PUBLIC OCCASIONS, IS PRAGAMTIC AND DEEPLY
CONCERNED OVER THE LONG TERM HEALTH OF THE TIN INDUSTRY.
MOREOVER, THE GOVERNING NATIONAL FRONT HAS JUST RECEIVED AN
IMPRESSIVE NEW MANDATE FROM THE ELECTORATE. IN LOCAL
DISCUSSION OF MALAYSI'S TIN INDUSTRY,  BOTH IN THE PRESS AND
PRIVATELY, THERE SEEMS TO BE GROWING ACKNOWLEDGMENT THAT THE
GOM AND STATE GOVERNMENTS MUST TAKE MEASURES TO STIMULATE PRODUCTION.
IDEALLY, BILATERAL DISCUSSIONSMIGHT FOLLOW COMPLETION OF US
LEGISLATIVE ACTION ON A BUFFER STOCK CONTRIBUTION AND ON STOCKPILE
RELEASES. HOWEVER, IN VIEW OF THE CONTINUING UNCERTAINTY
REGARDING CONGRESSIONAL ACTION, THE DEPARTMENT MAY WISH TO
CONSIDER EMBARKING ON A BILATERAL DIALOGUE BEFORE SUCH ACTION
IS COMPLETED. IN ANY CASE. WE FEEL SUCH DISCUSSIONS WOULD BE
USEFUL BEFORE THE NEXT ITC MEETING.
3. WE BELIEVE THAT THE INCREASED MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING THE
BILATERLA TALKS WOULD HOPEFULLY GENERATE MIGHT ACTUALLY HEIGHTEN
THE PROSPECTS OF INCREASED TIN PRODUCTIO IN MALYSIA. THE
GOM SEEMS HONESTLY FRUSTRATED BY THE DIFFICULTIES IT FACES, IN
GETTING THE COOPERATION OF STATE GOVERNMENTS (WHICH
CONSTITUTIONALLY CONTROL LAND USE) IN OPENING UP NEW LANDS TO
TIN MINING. IT APPEARS THAT THE MAJOR OBSTACLE TO INCREASED
TIN PRODUCTION IN MALAYSIA IS THE DELAY FACED BY MINERS IN
OBTAINING NEW AND RENEWED MINING LEASES FROM
THE STATE GOVERNMENTS OF TIN-RICH SELANGOR AND PERAK. THESE
DIFFICULTIES ARE EQUALLY SERIOUS FOR THE LARGE DREDGING COMPANIES
WITH SUBSTANTIAL FOREING INVESTMENT ANDFOR THE SMALL, MOSTLY
MALAYSIA,CHINESE GRAVEL PUMP OPERATINS. (SEE KUALA LUMPUR 8020).
4. THE MOST IMPORTANT EXAMPLE IS THE KUALA LANGGAT FIELD IN
SOUTHERN SELANGOR STATE. IT IS THE LARGEST KNOWN UNMINED TIN
FILED IN THE WORLD WITH A CAPACITY CONSERVATIVELY ESTIMATED AT
150,000 TONS OF TIN. A BRITISH DREDGINIG COMPANY FIST INDICATED
A SERIOUS INTEREST IN MINING THIS FIELD AS EARLY AS 1972 BUT WAS
UNABLE TO OBTAIN THE RIGHTS FROM THE STATE GOVERNMENT. IN
1977, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OWNED CORPORATION, PERNAS, OBTAINED
A CONTROLLING INTEREST IN THIS COMPANY AND CONFIDENTLY SET
FOTH TO REACH AGREEMENT WITH THE SELANGOR STATE GOVERNMENT ON
THE LAND ISSUE. NOW, ALMOST EIGHTEEN MONTHS LATER, NO RESOLUTION
IS YET IN SIGHT.
5. STATE LAND POLICIES HAVE ALSO BEEN IDENTIFIED AS ONE FO THE
PRIMARY REASONS FOR THE SHARP DECLINE IN THE NUMBER OF GRAVEL
PUMP OPERATIONS DESPITE RECORD TIN PRICES. GRAVEL PUMP
OPERATIONS PRODUCED OVER 51 PERCENT OF MALAYSIA'S 1977
TIN PRODUCTION . FURTHERMORE, THEY PROVIDE, IN THE ABSENCE
OF TOTHER CONSTRAINTS, REAL SHORT-TERM FLEXIBILITY IN
STARTIGN UP NEW PRODUCTION WHEN TIN PRICES INCREASE, THUS
PROVIDING CONSIDERABLY MORE SUPPLU ELASTICITY THAN DREDGING
OPERATIONS WHICH HAVE ASTART-UP TIME OF BETWEEN THREE
AND FIVE YEARS.

STADIS//////////////////////////////
6. OUR OBJECTIVE IN BILATERALL DISCUSSION  WOULD BE TO ENCOURAGE
THE GOM TO SEEK SOLUTIONS TO THESE GENUUINELY TOUGH INTERNAL
PROBLEMS BY EXPLORING SYMPATHETICALLY MEASURES THAT THE GOM
MIGHT TAKE AND AT THE SAME TIME BY OFFERING SOME IDEA OF
MEASURES WE WOULD BE WILLING TO TAKE TO MEET GOM CONCERNS IF
TIN PRODUCTION IS CLEARLY SEEN TO BE RISING. WE BELIEVE, FOR
EXAMPLE, THAT THE GOM MIGHT REALISTICALLY BE URGED TO TAKE SOME
OR ALL OF THE FOLLOWING MEASURES (LISTED IN DESCENDING ORDER
OF IMPORTANCE)
A. THE ACTIVE INVOLVEMENT OF EXISTING JOING STATE-FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT MINING COMMITTEES IN FINGING A LONG-TERM SOLUTION TO THE
LAND QUESTIONFOLLOWED BY SOME CONCRETE EVIDENCE THAT
GRAVEL PUMP OPERATIONS AND DREDGING COMPANIES ARE NOT
ENCOUNTERING UNDUE DIFFICULTIES IN OBTAINING NEW OR RENEWED
LEASES;
B. SPEEDY AND FAVORABLE RESOLUTION OF THE STALLED NEGOTIATIONS
BETWEEN SELANGOR AND THE MALAYSIAN MINING CORPORATION OVER
KUALA LANGGAT;
C. A REASONABLE REDUCTION IN THE TAXES NOW IMPOSED ON THE
INDUSTRY.
AS WE HAVE SAID BEFORE, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT A TAX REDUCTION
WOULD NECESSARILY INCREASE PRODUCTION. NEVERTHELESS, TAKEN
IN CONJUNCTION WITH PROGRAMS ON THE LAND QUESTON, IT WOULD
SET THE FOUNDATION FOR HEALTHY AND VIABLE TIN INDUSTRY
IN THE FUTURE. FINALLY, IT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL IF THE
GOM COULD, AS PORT OF THE PROCESS NECESSARY FOR DEALING
WITH THESE POITS, DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE NATIONAL
MINING POLICY. THIS WOULD PROVIDE THE PRIVATE SECTOR
WITH MUCH NEEDED ASSURANCES AS TO WHAT THE FUTURE
RULES OF THE GAME WOULD BE AND GIVE CIVIL SERVANTS A
CLEAR IDE OF WHAT GOM POLICY IS.
7. ON OUR SIDE, WE MIGHTN, AS THE TACTICAL SITUATION DICTATES,
EXPRESS WILLINGNESS TO SEE ABOMBINATION OF MEASURES
IMPLEMENTED, INCLUDING A RISE  IN THE PRICE BAND, A COMMITMENT
NOT TO ALLOW STOCKPILE DISPOSALS TO DRIVE THE PRICE
BELOW A CERTAIN AGREEDLEVEL WITH RESPECT TO THE PRICE BAND,
AND PERHAPS ADOPTION OF A SEMI-AUTOMATIC MECHANISM FOR SETTING
FUTURE PRICES.
8. WE RECOGNIZE, OF COURSE, THAT ANY RESULTS OF BILATERAL
US-GOM DISCUSSIONS WOULD ULTIMATELY HAVE TO BE ENDORSED BY
THE ITC, AND PERHAPS SIMILAR OR PARALLEL BILATERAL
CONSULTATIONS SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT WITH OTHER PRINCIPAL PRO-
DUCERS AND CONSUMERS. ADDRESSEE POSTS MAY WISH TO COMMENT.
IN ANY EVENT,  EVENT, IF THESE IDEAS HAVE ANY MERIT, WE SUGGEST
THAT DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY BOSWORTH AS SENIOR DEPARTMENT
OFFICIAL SUCH DISCUSSION HERE, AND POSSIBLY IN BANGKOK AND
JAKARTA, WITH SENIOR POLICY-MAKERS IN THE RESPECTIVE
LOCAL GOVERNMENT.
9. WE HAVE GIVEN THIS MESSAGE A STADISCAPTION, BUT WOULD HAVE
NO OBJECTION IF THE DEPARTMENT WISHES TO GIVE IT INTERAGENCY
CIRCULATION.
