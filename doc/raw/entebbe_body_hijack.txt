C. PARIS 19328, D. PARIS 19871
1. THE FOLLOWING IS A COMPOSITE REPORT ON SOME OF THE
ASPECTS OF THE RECENT HIJACKING OF THE AIR FRANCE
AIRBUS BASED ON CONVERSATIONS WITH A NUMBER OF THE
AMERICANS WHO WERE RELEASED.  THEIR ACCOUNTS WERE
GENERALLY CONGRUENT AND COINCIDE WITH THE REPORTS FROM
THE GERMAN EMBASSY IN KAMPALA (REF. A).  SINCE MANY
ASPECTS ARE A MATTER OF IMPRESSION RATHER THAN FIRM
OBSERVATION, THERE ARE SOME DIFFERENCES IN THE
ACCOUNTS, WHICH WE NOTE.  WE GO OVER SOME OF THE SAME
GROUND COVERED IN THE ACCOUNTS IN REFS B, C AND D.
THERE IS SOME CONFUSION OVER NOMENCLATURE FOR THE
THREE EIEMENTS INVOLVED IN THE HIJACKING.  ALL THE
AMERICANS REFERRED TO MEMBERS OF ALL THREE AS PLO
PRESUMABLY SINCE ENGLISH SPEAKING GERMANS WITH WHOM
THEY HAD MOST CONTACT SAID THEY WORKED FOR PLO.  BUT
THE ARABS ON THE GROUND WHO WERE APPARENTLY IN CHARGE
OF THE WHOLE CHE GUEVARA COMMANDO GROUP MADE THE
DISTINCTION AND SPECIFIED THEY WORKED FOR PFLP AND NOT
PLO.  GERMANS PERHAPS DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE
DISTINCTION.
2. RETAINED AMERICANS.  SOME OF THE AMERICANS HAD
IDENTIFIED GEORGE AND RENE KARFUNKEL AS AMERICANS AND
WERE AWARE THAT THEY HAD ONLY AMERICAN PASSPORTS AND
HAD BEEN IN ISRAEL ONLY BRIEFLY.  NO ONE HAD A
SATISFACTORY EXPLANATION OF WHY THE KARFUNKELS HAD NOT
BEEN RELEASED WITH THE OTHER AMERICANS.  THE KARFUNKELS
APPEARED VERY ORTHODOX, ATE ONLY KOSHER FOOD AND WERE
SEATED WITH THE ISRAELIS ABOARD THE PLANE AND REMAINED
WITH THEM EVEN ON THE GROUND BECAUSE THE COMMANDOS
PERMITTED THEM TO PREPARE KOSHER FOOD.  HOWEVER, THE
COMMANDOS GENERALLY WORKED FROM THE DOCUMENTS WHICH THEY
HAD COLLECTED AND THE PRINTED CARDS (IN ARABIC) WHICH
THEY HAD EACH PASSENGER FILL OUT.  THE COMMANDOS WERE
THEREFORE WELL AWARE THAT THE KARFUNKELS HAD AMERICAN
PASSPORTS ONLY.  ONE AMERICAN SUGGESTED THAT THEIR
FLAUNTING OF THEIR JEWISHNESS MIGHT HAVE ALIENATED SOME
OF THE ARABS IN THE COMMANDOS.  ON THE OTHER HAND,
OTHERS THOUGHT THEIR RETENTION MIGHT HAVE BEEN JUST AN
OVERSIGHT.  AS FOR JANET ALMOG, NONE OF THE AMERICANS
WE HAVE QUESTIONED WERE AWARE OF HER PRESENCE.  SHE WAS
PROBABLY RETAINED ON THE BASIS OF HER ISRAELI
DOCUMENTATION (AS WERE THE FRENCH/ISRAELI DUAL
NATIONALS) IN ADDITION TO HER BEING SEATED WITH THE
ISRAELIS.  THE AMERICANS NOTED THAT THE DUAL NATIONALS
HAD MADE NO ATTEMPTS TO DESTROY OR DISCARD THE EVIDENCE
OF THEIR ISRAELI CITIZENSHIP ALTHOUGH OTHERS HAD
DESTROYED SOME COMPROMISING DOCUMENTATION SUCH AS PRESS
CARDS.  HIJACKERS WHILE STILL ON PLANE WARNED THAT
QTE ANYONE WHO DESTROYED IDENTITY DOCUMENTS WOULD BE
SEVERELY PUNISHED END QTE.
3. ROLE OF THE HIJACKERS.  THE AMERICANS INVARIABLY
WERE OF THE IMPRESSION THAT THERE WERE TWO GERMANS
AND TWO RATHER INEXPERIENCED YOUNG ARABS WHO HAD TAKEN
OVER THE PLANE SHORTLY AFTER TAKEOFF FROM ATHENS.  THE
GERMAN MAN, BASIL CODE NAME KUBESKY - AFTER GERMAN
TERRORIST KILLED 1973, WAS THE OBVIOUS LEADER OF THE
HIJACK GROUP ALTHOUGH THE WOMAN WAS OFTEN THE MOST
VIRULENT.  WE REFER TO THE WOMAN AS QTE GERMAN END QTE
BECAUSE THE AMERICANS ALL DID.  SHE SPEAKS ENGLISH WITH
A DECIDED GERMAN ACCENT.  SOME SOURCES, HOWEVER, HAVE

BEEN ABLE TO IDENTIFY HER AS TURKISH TERRORIST, BERGAS
ETURK (PARIS 19514).  BASIL WAS OBVIOUSLY MORE
TECHNICALLY EXPERIENCED THAN THE YOUNG ARABS AND HELPED
THEM ASSEMBLE THE BOMBS WITH WHICH THEY THREATENED TO
BIOW UP THE AIRCRAFT.  SOME AMERICANS CONSIDERED THE
GERMANS TO BE SINCERE REVOLUTIONARIES WHO WERE NOT
WORKING MERELY FOR THE ACCOUNT OF THE PFLP OR PLO, BUT
ALSO TO FREE THEIR COLLEAGUES IMPRISONED IN GERMANY
WHOM THEY APPEARED TO KNOW PERSONALLY.  OTHERS THOUGHT
THAT THEY MIGHT BE BASICALLY MERCENARIES AND THAT THE
REAL LEADERS OF THE PFLP OR PLO WOULD NOT PUSH FOR THE
RELEASE OF THEIR GERMAN FRIENDS.  ON THE GROUND, THE
FOUR PLO WHO MOVED IN WHEN THEY REACHED ENTEBBE ASSUMED
PRINCIPAL COMMAND, BUT SOME CONSIDERED THAT QTE BASIL
END QTE CONTINUED TO BE QTE GENERAL MANAGER END QTE
OF THE GROUP AND WAS ABLE TO MAKE A MAJOR INPUT INTO
THE DECISIONS AS TO WHO SHOULD BE RELEASED, FOR EXAMPLE.
AT ALL EVENTS, THE GERMANS WERE VERY VOLUBLE IN THEIR
DISCUSSION OF THE NECESSITY OF WORLD REVOLUTION,
OVERTURNING WORLD IMPERIALISM AND CAPITALISM, AND PUT
ON A GOOD SHOW IN SUPPORT OF THE IDEOLOGICAL BASIS FOR
THEIR JOINING WITH THE OPPRESSED PALESTINIAN PEOPLE.
4. ROLE OF THE FOUR ARAB LEADERS IN UGANDA:  THE
PASSENGERS FOUND THE FOUR ARAB FIGURES WHO JOINED THE
GROUP WHEN IT LANDED IN ENTEBBE TO BE MORE
AUTHORITATIVE AND MUCH TOUGHER THAN THE FOUR HIJACKERS.
ALSO, WHILE THE GERMANS IN LAR FREQUENTLY
EMPHASIZED THAT THEY WERE NOT RACIST (I.E. ANTI-JEW),
THEY WERE ANTI-ZIONIST.  THE FOUR ARAB FIGURES WERE
HOWEVER, CLEARLY ANTI-JEW AND TOOK A CERTAIN SADISTIC
PLEASURE IN FORCING THE OLD JEWISH PASSENGERS TO PLEAD
TO BE AMONG THOSE SENT TO FRANCE.  TWO OF THIS GROUP
WERE TALL, ONE VERY HEAVY (OVER 200 POUNDS) AND WORE
BLACK MOUSTACHES.  A SHORT HEAVY-SET MAN WITH A COMICAL
FACE, AS THOUGH HE WERE WEARING THE STEREOTYPED BIG
NOSE/HORNRIMMED GLASSES MASK, APPEARED TO BE THE MOST
INFLUENTIAL.  ALTHOUGH MOST AMERICANS REFERRED TO THEM
AS ARABS, ONE COMMENTED THAT SHE HAD GATHERED HE WAS
A PERUVIAN -- AND HE SPOKE SPANISH AS WELL AS
ENGLISH AND FRENCH.  ANOTHER AMERICAN SAID HE HAD KNOWN
LATIN AMERICANS AND WAS SURE HE WAS MORE LIKELY A
LEBANESE.  ENGLISH WAS THE LANGUAGE USED BETWEEN THE
ARABS AND THE GERMANS, AND AFTER THE ARRIVAL IN UGANDA,
MOST CONVERSATIONS AMONG THE COMMANDO MEMBERS WERE
CONDUCTED OUTSIDE THE HEARING  OF THE PASSENGERS.
COMMANDOS SET UP AN QTE OFFICE END QTE IN THE CORNER
OF THE ROOM WHERE THEY DISCUSSED MATTERS.  THE
FOUR HIJACKERS WERE NOT ALWAYS INVITED TO THESE MEETINGS
ALTHOUGH ONLY QTE BASIL END QTE APPARENTLY DID NOT
SPEAK ARABIC.  GESTURES WERE THE PRINCIPAL MEANS OF
COMMUNICATION WHEN WITH THE PRISONERS.  THESE FOUR ARABS
APPEARED TO BE KNOWN BY SIGHT (PERHAPS THROUGH PHOTO-
GRAPHS) TO THE TWO GERMANS WHO VISIBLY SHOWED THEIR
RELIEF WHEN THEY APPROACHED THE PLANE AN HOUR OR MORE
AFTER IT LANDED.  IT WAS NOT CLEAR, HOWEVER, WHETHER
THEY WERE PFLP REPS WHO WERE STATIONED IN UGANDA OR HAD
COME IN FOR THE OCCASION.  FOUR ARABS NEVER SEEMED TAKE
TWO YOUNG SELF-PROFESSED PALESTINIANS INTO THEIR
CONFIDENCE.
5. ROLE OF AMIN.  WITHOUT EXCEPTION THE AMERICANS FOUND
AMIN REPELLENT AND DUPLICITOUS IN HIS TREATMENT OF THE
PRISONERS.  HE CLAIMED CREDIT FOR EVERYTHING WHICH
BENEFITTED THE PRISONERS FROM THE FOOD AND MATTRESSES
WHICH WERE SUPPLIED TO THE MORE CONCILIATORY ACTIONS OF
THE HIJACKERS.  THE PLO FIGURES ALSO WENT OUT OF THEIR
WAY TO GIVE CREDIT TO AMIN, WHAT APPEARED TO BE PART OF
THEIR EFFORT TO MAINTAIN HIS SUPPORT.  ALL AGREED THAT
AMIN HAD PROBABLY LEARNED THAT UGANDA WAS THE PLANE'S
DESTINATION BEFORE IT LANDED, AND SOME SPECULATED THAT
HE HAD BEEN AWARE OF THE PLOT BEFORE THE HIJACKING.
BASIS SAID WHEN THEY LEFT LIBYA FOR UGANDA THAT PERHAPS
AMIN WOULD BE AT THE AIRPORT WAITING FOR THEM.  THE
PLANE TAXIED AROUND THE FIELD FOR ABOUT AN HOUR BEFORE
BASIL GOT OFF THE PLANE AND MADE JOYFUL CONTACT WITH THE
FOUR WAITING ARAB FIGURES, BUT SOME AMERICANS THOUGHT
THAT THE DELAY COULD HAVE BEEN BECAUSE THEY WERE
EXPECTED AT KAMPALA AIRPORT OR THAT THERE HAD BEEN SOME
DELAY IN GETTING TOGETHER THE ARAB FIGURES AND THE
UGANDAN TROOPS.  IT WAS CLEAR THAT AMIN GAVE SUPPORT TO
THE COMMANDOS SINCE THEY ACQUIRED MORE AND MORE LETHAL
WEAPONS AFTER ARRIVAL AND THE UGANDAN TROOPS WERE

C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 04 PARIS 19568
CLEARLY THERE AS A BACK-UP FORCE NOT JUST QTE
IMPRISONING END QTE COMMANDOS BUT ALSO HELPING IMPRISON
PASSENGERS.  GIVEN THE PHYSICAL SET-UP, THE GREAT
NUMBER OF UGANDANS, AND THEIR CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE
PLO, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE EASY, MOST THOUGHT,
FOR THE UGANDANS TO HAVE DISARMED OR KILLED THE
COMMANDOS HAD THEY WISHED.  IN FACT, THE PASSENGERS
BEGAN TO FEAR THE UGANDANS EVEN MORE THAN THE FOUR
ARABS WHO HAD TAKEN OVER ON ARRIVAL, JUST AS THEY
INITIALLY HAD FEARED THE FOUR ARABS MORE THAN THE
ORIGINAL HIJACKERS.
6.  AMIN HIMSELF MADE NO BONES ABOUT HIS SYMPATHY FOR THE
THE AIMS OF THE COMMANDOS.  HE SAID THAT HE WAS HAPPY
TO HELP THE COMMANDOS SINCE HE SHARED THEIR OPINIONS.
HE TOLD THE PASSENGERS THAT IF THEIR GOVERNMENTS WISHED
TO SEE THEM ALIVE, THEY MUST COOPERATE IN MEETING THE
JUST DEMANDS OF THE HIJACKERS.
7.  SOME OF THE AMERICANS THOUGHT THAT AMIN HOPED
TO GET CREDIT FOR THE HUMANE TREATMENT OF THE
PASSENGERS AND THEIR RELEASE AND TO GET THE GRATITUDE
OF THE EXTREMIST ARABS BECAUSE OF HIS MAKING POSSIBLE
THE DETENTION OF THE PASSENGERS WITH NO RISK TO THE
HIJACKERS AND FACILITATING THE RELEASE OF TERRORISTS.
SOME CYNICALLY NOTED THAT UGANDA WAS MAKING A GREAT
DEAL OF MONEY OUT OF THE HIJACKING, BOTH FROM AIR
FRANCE PAYMENTS AND THE INDIVIDUAL EXPENDITURES BY THE
PASSENGERS -- $1 FOR TOILET PAPER, FOR EXAMPLE.
8. POSSIBLE ROLE OF SOME PASSENGERS.  SEVERAL AMERICANS
WERE SUSPICIOUS OF ONE OF THE JORDANIAN (SALMY) AND
EGYPTIAN PASSENGERS, BUT NOT OF THE MORROCAN.  SOME
THOUGH THAT SALMY AND THEEGYPTIAN BOTH WERE WORKING
WITH THE HIJACKERS AT LEAST AFTER THE EVENT, AND THAT
SALMY IN PARTICULAR SEEMED TO BE THE HIJACKERS SPY
AMONG THE PASSENGERS.  SOME EVEN THOUGHT THAT THE
JORDANIAN MIGHT HAVE HELPED THE HIJACKERS GET THEIR
ARMS AND EXPLOSIVES ON BOARD.  ONE AMERICAN BELIEVED
THAT ONE OF THE CANADIAN PASSENGERS, MIRIAM FIELD, HAD
HELPED BRING ARMS ABOARD IN HER HEAVY HANDBAG AND HAD
PASSED THEM TO THE GERMAN WOMAN WHEN SHE WENT TO THE
LADIES' ROOM ON THE WEAK EXCUSE OF WISHING TO FRESHEN
HER MAKEUP IMMEDIATELY AFTER TAKE OFF RATHER THAN
IMMEDIATELY BEFORE LANDING IN ORDER TO BE AT HER BEST
FOR PARIS.  CANADIAN EMBASSY OFFICIALS FOUND THAT
FIELD LEFT THE AIRPORT QUICKLY (WITH AN AMERICAN)
WITHOUT CHECKING IN WITH THEM AND SHE HAS NOT BEEN
STAYING AT THE HOTEL WHERE RESERVATIONS HAD BEEN MADE.
SINCE SHE WOULD BE WITHOUT DOCUMENTATION IF SHE HAD
BEEN TREATED LIKE THE OTHER PASSENGERS, CANADIANS ARE
SURPRISED THAT SHE HAS NOT BEEN IN CONTACT WITH THEM.
WE REPORT THE ABOVE AS MERELY THE IMPRESSIONS OF SOME
OF THE PASSENGERS, SPECULATION INDUCED BY THEIR
SURPRISE THAT EVEN THE LAX SECURITY AT THE ATHENS
AIRPORT HAD PERMITTED THE INTRODUCTION OF SUBSTANTIAL
ARMS.
9.  INTENTIONS OF THE HIJACKERS.  THE AMERICANS
GENERALLY THOUGHT THE HIJACKERS CONSIDERED THE MOST
IMPORTANT PUBLICITY WAS AT LEAST CONSIDERABLE IF NOT
TOTAL SUCCESS IN OBTAINING THE RELEASE OF PRISONERS
IN ISRAEL, FRANCE AND GERMANY, AT LEAST. THEY
THOUGHT THAT COMMANDOS DID NOT INTEND A GENERAL KILLING
OF THE ISRAELIS OR OF THE FRENCH YOUNG PASSENGERS AND
CREW, BUT THAT THEY MIGHT START BY SHOOTING ONE OR TWO
ISRAELIS FIRST TO EMPHASIZE THE SERIOUSNESS OF THEIR
DEMANDS.  THE ARABS SEEMED NOW RATHER SURE OF THEMSELVES
SINCE THEY NOW APPEARED CONVINCED OF COMPLETE BACKING
FROM AMIN.  (THE GERMANS, HOWEVER, HAD APPARENTLY
COMPLETELY DISLIKED AND DISTRUSTED AMIN PERHAPS
BECAUSE HE IS NOT AN INTELLECTUAL RATHER THAN OUT OF
REAL FEAR HE MIGHT TURN ON THEM.)  HE AMERICANS
THOUGHT THAT THE COMMANDOS' OPTIMISM WAS JUSTIFIED
SINCE THEY HELD ALL THE CARDS AND EVENTUALLY EVEN
ISRAEL WOULD BE FORCED TO YIELD, IN PART BECAUSE OF
DEMANDS FROM MANY RELATIVES OF THE ISRAELI CAPTIVES.
10. THE AMERICANS AT FIRST WERE SURPRISED AT THE
ANIMOSITY SHOWN TOWARD THE FRENCH GIVEN THE RATHER
PRO-ARAB GOF POLICY, BUT THE GERMANS TOLD THEM THAT NOT
ONLY HAD FRANCE HELPED ISRAEL MATERIALLY (NUCLEAR

ENERGY PLANT, MIRAGES, ETC.) BUT ALSO THE FRENCH
GOVERNMENT HAD PERMITTED ISRAELI AGENTS TO KILL 50 OF
THE PALESTINIAN AGENTS IN FRANCE WITHOUT ANY EFFORT BY
THE GOF TO FIND AND PROSECUTE THE ASSASSINS.  HENCE
THE DECISION TO ATTACK A FRENCH PLANE, TO HOLD
PRISONER THE FRENCH CREW AND SOME YOUNG FRENCH
PASSENGERS, AND TO MAKE HEAVY DEMANDS ON THE FRENCH
GOVERNMENT CONCERNING RELEASE OF PRISONERS.
11. SITUATION OF ISRAELI PRISONERS.  THE AMERICANS
SAID THAT THE ISRAELIS WERE WELL ORGANIZED, DISCIPLINED,
COHESIVE, BUT PASSIVE.  ALTHOUGH THE FRENCH APPLAUDED
EACH TIME AMIN MADE A THEATRICAL ENTRANCE IN A
DIFFERENT COSTUME, THE ISREALIS RESPONDED WITH SILENT
DEFIANCE.  THEY APPARENTLY HAVE NEVER CONSIDERED THE
POSSIBILITY OF RESISTANCE, NO DOUBT IN PART BECAUSE
SO MANY OF THEM ARE VERY OLD.  ONCE THEY WERE IN UGANDA
ALL THOUGHT OF RESISTANCE WAS UNREALISTIC SINCE THEY
ARE SURROUNDED BY HUNDREDS OF AMIN'S PARATROOPERS.
AMIN HAD SAID THAT IF THERE WERE AN ASSAULT FROM
OUTSIDE OR AN UPRISING WITHIN THE BUILDING, THE WHOLE
BUILDING WOULD BE BLOWN UP.  THE AMERICANS BELIEVE
THAT THIS IS NOT TRUE, AND THAT BOXES SOME THOUGHT
MIGHT BE FILLED WITH DYNAMITE WERE REALLY DESIGNED
JUST TO BLOCK OFF A DOOR.  IN ANY CASE, THE ISRAELIS
KNOW THAT THEIR CHANCES OF RESCUE OR ESCAPE ARE NIL.
THE DISTRESS HAS INCREASED AS THEY HAVE SEEN TWO
PLANELOADS OF OTHER PASSENGERS LEAVE, BUT THEY HAVE
REMAINED STOIC.  A FEW MORE DAYS UNDER THESE
CIRCUMSTANCES COULD CAUSE SOME OF THE OLD AND INFIRM
TO BREAK -- JUST AS TWO OLD FRENCH WOMEN BROKE THE
NIGHT OF THEIR ARRIVAL IN UGANDA.
12. THE GERMANS HERE HAVE ALREADY EXPRESSED AN
INTEREST IN OUR REPORTS OF THE OBSERVATIONS AND
OPINIONS OF THE AMERICAN PASSENGERS.  WE SUGGEST THE
DEPARTMENT DECIDE WHETHER THE ABOVE SHOULD BE
FURNISHED WHOLE OR IN PART TO CERTAIN FRIENDLY
GOVERNMENTS.

1. AT A PRESS CONFERENCE ON JULY 4, FEDERAL COUNCILOR
KURT FURGLER (CHIEF OF JUSTICE AND POLICE MINISTRY) ON
BEHALF OF SWISS GOVT EXPRESSED RELIEF OVER THE
FREEING OF THE HOSTAGES. FURGLER ALSO NOTED THAT KAMPALA
WILL NOT BE THE END OF THE STORY; THE PALESTINE PROBLEM
REMAINS.
2. IN A REVIEW OF LAST WEEK'S EVENTS, FURGLER STRESSED
THE CLOSE COORDINATION WITH PARIS, BONN AND TEL AVIV.
FURGLER MENTIONED THAT THE GOS ATTEMPTED ON JULY 1-2, THROUGH
THE ZAIRIAN AMBASSADOR IN BERN, TO GET PRESIDENT MOBUTO TO
INTERVENE IN UGANDA IN EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE A BLOODLESS
SOLUTION. AS PRESSURE FROM KAMPALA MOUNTED, THE FEDERAL
COUNCIL MET SEVERAL TIMES ON JULY 3. IN THE EVENING,
THE FEDERAL COUNCIL FINALLY DECIDED NOT TO RELEASE
PETRA KRAUSE. IN A TELEGRAM TO THE PFLP THROUGH THE
FRENCH GOVT THE FEDERAL COUNCIL STATED THAT THERE
WAS NO PALESTINIAN FREEDOM FIGHTER IN SWISS JAILS. FURGLER
STRESSED THE DECISION CAME BEFORE GOS HAD KNOWLEDGE OF THE
ISRAELI COMMANDO ACTION.
3. SWISS REACTED POSITIVELY TO THE ISREALI LIBERATION OF
HOSTAGES. ISREALI EMBASSY HAS BEEN SWAMPED WITH CONGRATULATORY
CALLS. EDITORIAL COMMENTS HAVE STRONGLY ENDORSED ISRAELI
ACTION; NEUE ZURCHER ZEITUNG EDITORIAL NOTED THAT " THE
PRESENT MASTER OF UGANDA PLACES HIMSELF ABOVE ALL LAW;
HE MORE OR LESS COOPERATED WITH INTERNATIONAL CRIMINALS IN
THE PRESENT CASE. THE DEFENSE OF THE LAW THROUGHOUT THE
WORLD IS SERVED MORE IF A SMALL FELLOW IN AN EMERGENCY
EXCEEDS MISUSED RULES OF THE GAME THROUGH A BRAVE ACT THAN
IF GREAT NATIONS ALLOW THEMSELVES TO BE BLACKMAILED BY
CRIMINAL FREEBOOTERS AND POLITICAL AMOK RUNNERS." ONLY
SOUR EDITORIAL NOTE WAS STRUCK IN JOURNAL DE GENEVE WHICH
SAID THAT REACTION WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT HAD ISRAELI
ACTION TAKEN PLACE IN SWITZERLAND (IGNORING THAT CIRCUMSTANCES
THEN WOULD HAVE BEEN GREATLY DIFFERENT).

REF :  (A) STATE 166529; (B) STATE 79:345
1.  SUMMARY.  IN MEETING RELATING TO ISRAEL'S ACTION IN
UGANDA, GOR SPOKESMAN APPRECIATED U.S.' POSITION AGAINST
TERRORISM AND IN FAVOR OF BALANCE, BUT MAINTAINED THAT
ISRAEL'S VIOLATION OF UGANDA'S TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY WAS
PRIMARY ISSUE AND INTIMATED GOR SUPPORT FOR ANTI-ISRAELI
RESOLUTION IN UNSC.  END SUMMARY.
2.  AS PER REFTEL A, EMBASSY POLITICAL COUNSELOR
INFORMED MFA JURIDICAL DIRECTORATE COUNSELOR GHEORGHE
SAULESCU OF USG INTENTION TO OPPOSE ONE-SIDED UGANDA-
OR OAU-SPONSORED RESOLUTION IN UNSC CONDEMNING ISRAEL AND/OR
KENYA REGARDING ISRAELI RESCUE OPERATION.  GOR WAS INFORMED
THAT USG WOULD SPONSOR BALANCED RESOLUTION CONDEMNING
"ALL STATES WHICH FAILED TO ACT VIGOROUSLY AGAINST
TERRORIST ACTS."
3.  SAULESCU SAID THAT GOR CONDEMNS ANY ATTACK BY ONE
STATE AGAINST TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY OF ANOTHER STATE,
AND SUPPORTS ABSOLUTELY NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY AND
INDEPENDENCE "WITHOUT REGARD TO THE PRETEXTS" OF THE
ATTACKING STATE.  USG POSITION WITH REGARD TO INTER-
NATIONAL LAW AND TREATIES ON TERRORISM WERE RECOGNIZED,
AND USG WAS WELL AWARE OF ROMANIAN VIEW THAT TERRORISM
IS "NEGATIVE ACT AGAINST INTERNATIONAL EXISTENCE."
HOWEVER, GOR COULD FIND NO EXCUSE OR JUSTIFICATION FOR
ISRAEL'S "DANGEROUS" ACTION.
4.  ASKED TO WHAT EXTENT GOR COULD SUPPORT GENERAL
RESOLUTION AGAINST TERRORISM CONSISTENT WITH 1972 TERRORISM
CONVENTION, SAULESCU STATED THAT QUESTIONS OF VIOLATION OF
SOVEREIGNTY AND TERRORISM WERE TWO SEPARATE PROBLEMS. AND
THAT UN ALREADY HAD COMMITTEE ON TERRORISM.  SAULESCU
ASKED WHETHER UGANDA WAS SIGNATORY TO 1972 TREATY, STATING
THAT NO COUNTRY CAN BE COMMITTED TO A PRINCIPLE OF INTER-
NATIONAL LAW WITHOUT ITS CONSENT.  UNIVERSALLY ACCEPTED
DEFINITION OF "TERRORIST ACT" DID NOT EXIST.  HE INTIMATED
THAT WESTERN COUNTRIES HAD RECENTLY APPLAUDED SOVIET
JEWISH
HIJACKING OF SOVIET PLANE IN LENINGRAD.  EMBOFF DID NOT KNOW
WHETHER UGANDA HAD ADHERED TO 1972 TREATY, BUT REITEREATED
TOTAL U.S. OPPOSITION TO HIJACKING FROM ANY SOURCE.  SAULESCU
THEN ASKED IF U.S. COULD SUPPORT "BALANCED" RESOLUTION WHICH
CONDEMNED BOTH VIOLATION OF NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY AND
TERRORIST ACTIONS.  EMBOFF REPLIED THAT BALANCE WAS
INTENTION OF U.S. SPONSORED RESOLUTION, BUT THAT GOR COULD
NOT SUPPORT ANY RESOLUTION WHICH MADE SPECIFIC CONDEMNATIONS OR
WHICH PLACED INCIDENT'S RESPONSIBILITY SOLELY ON ONE PARTY.
5. ##
OF UGANDA PRESIDENT
AMIN'S ASSISTANCE TO OR ACCEPTANCE OF TERRORISTS.  EMBOFF

OF TERRORISM ##            ISSUE IN COMPARISON WITH ABSOLUTE

1.  WE DO NOT BELIEVE IT ADVISABLE TO TRY TO DEBRIEF
CAPTAIN BACOS OR OTHER MEMBERS OF THE AIR FRANCE CREW
DIRECTLY, AND WE DOUBT THAT THEY WOULD BE PERMITTED TO
DO SO BY AIR FRANCE AND THE GOF.  LE MONDE OF JULY 6
QUOTES THE "MECHANICS OFFICER" OF THE AIRBUS, SPEAKING
IN THE NAME OF THE CREW, AS THANKING PRESIDENT IDI
AMIN DADA "FOR HIS CONSTANT CARE TO ASSURE OUR
SECURITY, OUR MATERIAL COMFORT AND SANITATION".  LE
MONDE OF JULY 7 GIVES THE CAPTAIN'S ACCOUNT IN WHICH HE
SAID HE HAD THE MECHANICS OFFICER READ THE CREW STATE-
MENT BECAUSE HE HAD LOST HIS VOICE.  HE SAID FURTHER,
"THE UGANDAN AUTHORITIES MADE EFFORTS TO ASSURE TO THE
HOSTAGES DECENT MATERIAL CONDITIONS.  IT WAS NOT A
QUESTION OF ANYTHING ELSE".
2.  DEPARTMENT'S ATTENTION DIRECTED TD AFP-093 OF
JULY 7 FROM PARIS WHICH CONTAINS THE HIGHLIGHTS OF A
PRESS CONFERENCE GIVEN THE SAME DAY AT AIR FRANCE
HEADQUARTERS BY BACOS AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE AIRBUS
CREW.  CONCERNING UGANDAN INVDLVEMENT, BACOS SAID THAT
AFTER THE PLANE'S STOP AT BENGHAZI, THE HIJACKERS
INSTRUCTED THE PILOTS TO PREPARE FOR A FLIGHT OF 2000
NAUTICAL MILES, WITHOUT INDICATING DESTINATION.  THE
PILOTS KNEW ONLY ONE AND A HALF HOURS BEFORE THEIR
ARRIVAL THAT KAMPALA WAS THEIR DESTINATION.  BACOS WAS
THEN AUTHORIZED TO MAKE RADIO CONTACT WITH ANOTHER PLANE
IN FLIGHT BELONGING TO EAST AFRICAN AIRLINES TO RE-
CEIVE INFORMATION ON LANDING CONDITION AT ENTEBBE.
THE PLANE LANDED THERE AT 04:30 HOURS LOCAL, AND FOR AN
HOUR, ON INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE CONTROL TOWER, TAXIED
ON THE LANDING STRIP.  "IT APPEARED THAT A CERTAIN CON-
FUSION WAS THE BASIS FOR THE CONTRADICTORY ORDERS
GIVEN BY THE CONTROL TOWER WHICH CAUSED THIS HOUR-LONG
PROMENADE."
3.  BACOS SAID THE PLANE WAS FINALLY AUTHORIZED TO
STOP AT THE END OF THE STRIP.  ABOUT ONE O'CLOCK,
ORDERS WERE GIVEN TO START THE MOTORS AND TO
MOVE THE PIANE NEAR THE OLD TERMINAL ABOUT 500
METERS AWAY.  PRESIDENT AMIN, SURROUNDED BY SOLDIERS,

WAS STANDING BEFORE THE TERMINAL.  TWO MEN, APPARENTLY
PALESTINIANS, HAD THE PASSENGERS DISEMBARK AHD LED
THEM TO THE TERMINAL.
4.  ACCORDING TO THE CREW, CONTINUES THE AFP ITEM,
THREE OTHER PALESTINIANS JOINED THE FOUR PIRATES WHO
HAD HIJACKED THE PLANE AND PARTICIPATED IN GUARDING THE
HOSTAGES.  TWO OTHER MEN, NOT IDENTIFIED BY THE CREW,
WENT BACK AND FORTH BUT DID NOT
PARTICIPATE IN GUARDING.  AT NO TIME DID UGANDAN TROOPS
ENTER THE TERMINAL WAITING ROOM; THEY WERE STATIONED
AT SOME DISTANCE FROM IT AND CONSTITUTED A SORT OF
SECURITY CORDON.  AMIN VISITED THE HOSTAGES SEVERAL
TIMES AND TOLD THEM THAT HE WAS BUSY WORKING FOR THEM
AND HAD MADE CONTACTS WITH DIFFERENT GOVERNMENTS TO
LIBERATE THEM.
5.  COMMENT:  IT SEEMS CLEAR THAT AIR FRANCE AND THE
GOF DO NOT WISH FURTHER TO COMPLICATE THEIR
RELATIONS WITH ARAB COUNTRIES AND PARTICULARLY AMIN
AND WILL THEREFORE DOWNPLAY ANY ASPECT OF CLEAR
LINKAGE OF UGANDANS WITH THE HIJACKERS.  RECOVERY OF
THE PLANE IS NO DOUBT OF HIGHER PRIORITY THAN FURTHER
TESTIMONY SHOWING AMIN'S SUPPORT FDR THE HIJACKERS,
WHICH IS PRETTY GENERALLY ASSUMED HERE WHERE MUCH OF
THE EVIDENCE CITED IN STATE 167345 HAS BEEN REPORTED
BY THE MEDIA.

CREW.  PRIME MINISTER RABIN COMES IN FOR SPECIAL PRAISE FROM ALL
QUARTERS.  PRESS WARNS AGAINST EXCESSIVE EUPHORIA, AND URGES CONSTANT
VIGILANCE IN CONTINUING FIGHT AGAINST
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.  COMMENTATORS NOTE THAT FLAGGING NATIONAL
MORALE HAS RECEIVED BADLY-NEEDED AND LONG-AWAITED BOOST.  PRESI-
DENTIAL
MESSAGE IS INTERPRETED AS SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL IN UPCOMING UNSC
DEBATE.  END SUMMARY
1.  ALL NEWSPAPERS JULY 5 DEVOTE EXTENSIVE FRONTPAGE COVERAGE AND
EDITORIAL COMMENTARY TO IDF RESCUE OPERATION OF ISRAELI HOSTAGES AND
AIR FRANCE CREW FROM ENTEBBE AIRPORT.  PRESS ACCOUNTS FOCUS ON
DESCRIPTION OF THE OPERATION, LOCAL AND WORLD REACTION TO IT,
COVERAGE OF RABIN'S KNESSET STATEMENT AND PRESS CONFERENCE WITH
DEFENSE MINISTER PERES AND IDF LEADERS.
2.  ALL EDITORIALS PRAISE THE GOVERNMENT'S DECISION WITH SPECIAL
MENTION FOR THE ROLE PLAYED BY PRIME MINISTER RABIN.  THEY ARE UNAN-
IMOUS
IN LAUDING THE IDF IN SUPERLATIVES FOR ITS HEROISM AND DARING IN
CARRYING OUT RESCUE OPERATION UNDER EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES AND
AT
GREAT DISTANCE FROM ISRAEL.  FOLLOWING IS A SAMPLE OF REPRESENTATIVE
EDITORIAL COMMENT.
3.  JERUSALEM POST DESCRIBES THE OPERATION AS "A LIGHTNING COMMANDO
RAID OF EXCEPTIONAL BRILLIANCE AND DARING", EMPHASIZING THAT "THE
ACTION WAS NOT MERELY A STRIKE FOR ISRAEL'S FREEDOM BUT WAS A BLOW
FOR
HUMANITY AS WELL."  THE EDITORIAL CONCLUDES ON A NOTE OF CAUTION THAT
"WHAT THE COUNTRY SHOULD CONCERN ITSELF WITH IS THE DANGER THAT THE
PRESENT MOOD OF EXULTATION MAY GROW
INTO RECKLESS EUPHORIA.  THE TERRORIST MOVEMENT HAS BEEN BADLY HURT,
BUT IT MAY BREAK OUT AFRESH IN A VINDICTIVE SPASM OF VIOLENCE.  AS
THE PRIME MINISTER SUGGESTED YESTERDAY, FRESH EFFORTS AND NEW
METHODS OF COMBATTING TERRORISM MAY HAVE TO BE CONSIDERED."
4.  AL HAMISHMAR COMMENTS THAT "SINCE THE OCTOBER WAR THE ISRAELI
NATION HAS NOT BEEN SPOILED BY MANY SUCCESSES, AND IT WOULD SEEM THAT
THIS IMPORTANT AND VITAL OPERATION WILL ENABLE THE NATION TO HOLD
ITS HEAD HIGH AND TO HAVE ITS SELF-CONFIDENCE RESTORED."
5.  HAARETZ EDITORIAL, AFTER LAUDING THE GOVERNMENT AND IDF, GOES
ON TO NOTE THAT "THE PRESSURE ON THE GOVERNMENT BY THE HOSTAGES'
FAMILIES HOWEVER UNDERSTANDABLE IT MAY BE REVEALED A WEAK SPOT
WHICH SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN EXPOSED.  THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME
THAT OUR ENEMIES COULD HAVE GAINED THE IMPRESSION THAT THERE IS A
DEFECTIVE ELEMENT IN ISRAEL'S POSTURE OF STEADFASTNESS SINCE IT IS
UNUSUALLY SENSITIVE TO THE SUFFERING OF THE INDIVIDUAL."  HAARRTZ
RECALLS THAT AFTER THE OCTOBER WAR THE MEIR GOVERNMENT WAS SUBJECTED
TO SIMILAR PRESSURE FOR THE RELEASE OF POWS AND THE RETURN OF THE
BODIES FROM EGYPT AND SYRIA, "A PRESSURE WHICH REDUCED THE MANEUV-
ERABILITY OF THE GOVERNMENT IN ITS NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE OTHER
SIDE."
6.  DAVAR WRITES THAT "ISRAEL IS ENTITLED TO EXPECT WORLDWIDE
APPRECIATION FOR THE OPERATION SINCE IT WAS CARRIED OUT NOT ONLY FOR
ITS OWN CITIZENS BUT IN THE INTEREST OF ALL THE OTHER STATES WHICH
ARE VULNERABLE TO THE DANGER OF THE TERRORIST INTERNATIONAL."
7.  DAVAR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT BARNEA NOTES "PRESIDENT FORD'S
UNRESERVED SUPPORT FOR THE OPERATION" AND OBSERVES THAT "THE POLI-
TICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE LIES IN ITS PROMISE OF
GUARANTEED SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL IN THE EXPECTED SECURITY COUNCIL DEBATE
ON UGANDA'S COMPLAINT AND IN ANY OTHER INTERNATIONAL FORUM DEALING
WITH THIS SUBJECT."
8.  HAARETZ POLITICAL COMMENTATOR GOLAN, USUALLY AN OUTSPOKEN CRITIC
OF
THE GOVERNMENT, ANALYZES THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS REGARDING THE
HIJACKED AIRCRAFT.  HE WRITES THAT "AT ALL STAGES THE ISRAELI GOVERN-
MENT
DEMONSTRATED UNSURPASSED LEADERSHIP.  ALL CONTROVERSIES, WHETHER
PETTY
OR LARGE, HAVE VANISHED AND THE LEADERSHIP ACTED IN A UNITED FASHION
TOWARDS ONE GOAL: THE SAFE RELEASE OF THE HOSTAGES.  THE RESULT WAS
BALANCED DECISIONS AND CORRECT STEPS LEADING TO A FINAL RESULT
WHICH NOT ONLY WAS OPERATIONALLY SUCCESSFUL BUT ALSO ACCEPTABLE
IN WORLD CAPITOLS."
9.  HAARETZ MILITARY COMMENTATOR SCHIFF DESCRIBES THE MILITARY AS-
PECTS
OF THE OPERATION, ATTRIBUTING ITS SUCCESS TO "EFFICIENT PLANNING,
TACTICAL BRILLIANCE, SURGICAL PRECISION IN EXECUTION BUT ALSO A GREAT
DEAL OF LUCK."  SCHIFF PRAISES THE "SUPERB INTELLIGENCE JOB ON THE
GROUND" DESCRIBING IT AS "A CENTRAL ELEMENT IN THE SUCCESS OF THE
RESCUE OPERATION".
FINALLY, HE NOTES THAT "IT WAS NOT ONLY AN ISRAELI AND JEWISH
VICTORY OVER PALESTINIAN TERRORISM BUT ALSO THE VICTORY OF CIVILIZA-
TION
OVER ARAB TERRORISM WHICH IN RECENT YEARS HAS JOINED FORCES WITH
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM."

TRIPOLI INFO USUN NY
TEL AVIV | UGANDAN ROLE IN AIR FRANCE HIJACKING
NOTAL
1.  ADDRESSEES OF REFTEL HAVE UNDERSTANDABLY ASKED FOR SUCH
EVIDENCE AS IS AVAILABLE AND USEABLE WITH FOREIGN GOVERN-
MENTS REGARDING THE UGANDAN ROLE IN ASSISTING PALESTINIAN
HIJACKERS OF THE AIR FRANCE AIRLINER HELD AT ENTEBBE.
2.  A KEY INDICATION OF GENERAL AMIN'S ATTITUDE IS
CONTAINED IN HIS STATEMENT AT THE OAU AFTER THE ISRAELI
RESCUE OPERATION IN WHICH HE DEFINED HIS ROLE.  IN THE
COURSE OF THIS STATEMENT HE STATED, INTER ALIA, THAT
"THE PRESENCE OF SEVERAL EUROPEANS AMONG THE HIJACKERS
INDICATED THE SUPPORT WHICH THE PALESTINIANS HAD".
SECONDLY, HE STATED, THAT IN HIS VIEW NOT ALL THE
ISRAELIS ABOARD THE AIRLINER DESERVED TO BE EXECUTED.
3.  THESE TWO STATEMENTS REVEAL AMIN'S OWN DESIRE TO
RATIONALIZE THE SYMPATHY HE SHOWED THE HIJACKERS AND
THE JUSTIFICATION FOR THEIR THREATS AGAINST THE
PASSENTERS, OR AT LEAST SOME OF THEM.
4.  THE FOLLOWING ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE HAS DEVELOPED
CONCERNING THE UGANDIAN ROLE.  POSTS MAY USE THIS
INFORMATION AS APPROPRIATE.
5.  TESTIMONY SUGGESTING THAT AMIN WAS NOT IN CAHOOTS
WITH THE HIJACKERS HAS BEEN PROVIDED BY MEMBERS OF THE
AIR FRANCE CREW, WHO MAY BE HOPING TO SAVE THE PLANE.
-- THE FRENCH FLIGHT ENGINEER, ON RETURN TO PARIS,
ON JULY 4, READ A STATEMENT PRAISING AMIN FOR "HIS
CONSTANT CONCERN AND FOR A NURSE AND A DOCTOR PUT
CONSTANTLY AT THE PASSENGERS' DISPOSAL."
-- ON JULY 5, THE COMMANDER OF THE AIR FRANCE PLANE
DENIED THAT UGANDAN SOLDIERS HAD EVER "SUBSTITUTED FOR
THE HIJACKERS," AND SAID THAT "THE WATCH OVER US WAS
EXCLUSIVELY SECURED BY THE HIJACKERS."
WE HAVE HEARD ONE REPORT THAT AMIN'S BEHAVIOR MAY HAVE
BEEN CONDITIONED IN PART BY HIS DESIRE TO EFFECT THE
RELEASE OF PALESTINIANS (OR UGANDIANS?) HELD IN KENYA.
6.  THE FOLLOWING EVIDENCE HOWEVER PRESENTS A DIFFERENT
PICTURE.
-- BASED ON THE DEBRIEFING OF PASSENGERS, THE
GERMAN TERRORIST BOESE RADIOED THE POPULAR FRONT FOR
THE LIBERATION OF PALESTINE (PFLP) OFFICE IN KAMPALA
AND WAS MET ON ARRIVAL AT ENTEBBE BY TWO ADDITIONAL
TERRORISTS AND LATER BY THREE MORE.  UGANDAN TROOPS
ENCIRCLED THE AREA, BUT FRATERNIZED WITH THE TERRORISTS
AND ON OCCASION MAINTAINED GUARD OVER ONE OR ANOTHER
GROUP OF HOSTAGES WHEN NO TERRORIST WAS PRESENT.  THE
REPORT CONCLUDED THAT AMIN WAS COMPLETELY HAND-IN-
GLOVE WITH THE TERRORISTS AND NOTED THE IMPRESSION OF
THE PASSENGERS THAT AMIN WAS IN ON THE AFFAIR FROM
THE BEGINNING.
-- A RELIABLE WESTERN DIPLOMATIC SOURCE (FYI
THE WEST GERMAN EMBASSY IN KAMPALA END FYI) REPORTED
THAT THE UGANDANS HAD NO PRIOR KNOWLEDGE OF THE HIJACKING
BUT THAT THEY WERE ACTIVELY ASSISTING THE TERRORISTS,
THEY BELIEVED.  THE SOURCE UNDERSTOOD THAT AMIN HAD
PERMITTED REINFORCEMENTS TO JOIN THE TERRORISTS.  THESE
REINFORCEMENTS APPARENTLY WERE PALESTINIANS ALREADY IN
UGANDA TRAINING THE ARMY.  ACCORDING TO THE SOURCE,
UGANDAN TROOPS HAD RELIEVED THE TERRORISTS IN GUARDING
THE HOSTAGES DURING THE NIGHT OF JULY 1 SO THAT THE
LATTER COULD SLEEP.
7.  MORE DIRECT EVIDENCE OF UGANDAN BEHAVIOR COMES FROM
EMBASSY PARIS' DEBRIEFING OF AMERICANS AMONG THE
PASSENGERS RELEASED BEFORE THE ISRAELI RAID:
"...ALL (AMERICANS) AGREED THAT AMIN HAD PROBABLY
LEARNED THAT UGANDA WAS THE PLANE'S DESTINATION BEFORE
IT LANDED, AND SOME SPECULATED THAT HE HAD BEEN AWARE
OF THE PLOT BEFORE THE HIJACKING.  BOESE SAID WHEN THEY
LEFT LIBYA FOR UGANDA THAT PERHAPS AMIN WOULD BE AT THE
AIRPORT WAITING FOR THEM.  THE PLANE TAXIED AROUND THE
FIELD FOR ABOUT AN HOUR BEFORE BOESE GOT OFF THE PLANE
AND MADE JOYFUL CONTACT WITH THE FOUR WAITING ARAB
FIGURES....  IT WAS CLEAR THAT AMIN GAVE SUPPORT TO THE
COMMANDOS (I.E., HIJACKERS) SINCE THEY ACQUIRED MORE
AND MORE LETHAL WEAPONS AFTER ARRIVAL AND THE UGANDAN
TROOPS WERE CLEARLY THERE AS A BACK-UP FORCE NOT JUST
'IMPRISONING' COMMANDOS BUT ALSO HELPING IMPRISON
PASSENGERS.  GIVEN THE PHYSICAL SET-UP, THE GREAT
NUMBER OF UGANDANS, AND THEIR CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE
PLO, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE EASY, MOST THOUGHT, FOR
THE UGANDANS TO HAVE DISARMED OR KILLED THE COMMANDOS
HAD THEY WISHED.  IN FACT, THE PASSENGERS BEGAN TO
FEAR THE UGANDANS EVEN MORE THAN THE FOUR ARABS WHO HAD
TAKEN OVER ON ARRIVAL, JUST AS THEY INITIALLY HAD
FEARED THE FOUR ARABS MORE THAN THE ORIGINAL HIJACKERS.
"AMIN HIMSELF MADE NO BONES ABOUT HIS SYMPATHY FOR THE
AIMS OF THE COMMANDOS.  HE SAID THAT HE WAS HAPPY TO
HELP THE COMMANDOS SINCE HE SHARED THEIR OPINIONS.  HE
TOLD THE PASSENGERS THAT IF THEIR GOVERNMENTS WISHED
TO SEE THEM ALIVE, THEY MUST COOPERATE IN MEETING THE
JUST DEMANDS OF THE HIJACKERS."
8.  AMIN'S VARIOUS ACTIONS COULD IN PART BE EXPLAINED
BY HIS ASSERTION THAT NOT TO HAVE ACCEDED TO THE
TERRORIST DEMANDS WOULD HAVE ENDANGERED THE LIVES OF
THE HOSTAGES.  HOWEVER, THE APPARENT USE OF UGANDAN
TROOPS TO GUARD THE HOSTAGES AND AMIN'S OWN STATEMENTS
TO PASSENGERS THAT HE WAS HAPPY TO HELP THE TERRORISTS
SINCE HE SHARED THEIR OPINIONS INDICATE THAT THE
UGANDAN FORCES NOT ONLY MADE NO ATTEMPT TO CAPTURE THE
TERRORISTS, BUT PROVIDED THEM AID AND COMFORT AS WELL.
9.  FOLLOWING ARE ADDITIONAL CITATIONS FROM OPEN PRESS
ACCOUNTS PROVIDED BY ISRAELI EMBASSY, WHICH HELP TO
FLESH OUT THE MATERIAL CITED ABOVE.  BEGIN TEXT
QUOTE FRENCH OFFICIALS SEE SIGNS AMIN, HIJACKERS
COLLUDED (SPECIAL TO THE NEW YORK TIMES) PARIS, JULY 4 -
OFFICIALS AND RELEASED HOSTAGES SAID HERE TODAY THAT
THEY HAD SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE THAT PRESIDENT IDI AMIN
HAD BEEN IN COLLUSION WITH THE HIJACKERS OF AN AIR
FRANCE AIRBUS IN THE SEIZURE OF THE PLANE AS WELL AS
AFTER IT LANDED IN UGANDA ....
A HIGHLY PLACED FRENCH SOURCE SAID THAT PRESIDENT AMIN
HAD REFUSED TO ALLOW PIERRE RENARD, THE FRENCH
AMBASSADOR TO UGANDA, OR A SPECIAL FRENCH ENVOY TO
DEAL WITH THE HIJACKERS DIRECTLY.  WHILE PRESIDENT AMIN
WAS OUT OF THE COUNTRY, MESSAGES (TO AND) FROM ISRAEL
HAD TO BE PASSED BY FRENCH GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVES
THROUGH THE SOMALIAN AMBASSADOR . . .
WHEN GENERAL AMIN RETURNED FROM MAURITIUS YESTERDAY,
HE RESUMED THE ROLE OF MEDIATOR.  HE TOLD THE FRENCH
AMBASSADOR THAT DEMANDS FOR THE RELEASE OF 53 PRO-
PALESTINIAN PRISONERS IN ISRAEL, KENYA AND EUROPE
MUST BE MET BY EARLY TODAY, OR ALL THE HOSTAGES WOULD
BE KILLED.
OFFICIALS HERE POINTED OUT THAT ON THE LIST OF PRISONERS
WERE FIVE UGANDANS HELD IN KENYA ON CHARGES OF ATTEMPTING
TO ASSASSINATE PRESIDENT JOMO KENYATTA . . . ENDQUOTE

ENTEBBE AND EMBRACING THE LEADER OF THE GANG THAT HAD
HIJACKED THE FRENCH AIRBUS OVER GREECE. END QUOTE
(SUNDAY TIMES, LONDON, JULY 4, 1976) END TEXT.
10.  ACCORDING TO ASSOCIATED PRESS REPORTS, THE LONDON
OBSERVER AND THE SUNDAY TIMES QUOTED SEVERAL OF THE
RELEASED HOSTAGES AS SAYING THAT THERE WAS FULL
COLLABORATION BETWEEN UGANDA'S PRESIDENT IDI AMIN AND
HIS MEN AND THE HIJACKERS:
(A)  WHEN AMIN ARRIVED ON THE SCENE, HE AND THE LEADER
OF THE TERRORISTS EMBRACED; AMIN ALSO SHOOK HANDS WITH
SOME OF THE OTHER HIJACKERS;
(B)  THE SUNDAY TIMES (JULY 4) WROTE THAT "THE UGANDANS
SUPPLIED ADDITIONAL WEAPONS TO THE HIJACKERS," AND THAT
"PALESTINIANS LIVING IN UGANDA ALSO JOINED THE HIJACKERS
AT THE AIRPORT."
(C)  UGANDAN SOLDIERS INTERMITTENTLY TOOK OVER THE
HIJACKERS' GUARD FUNCTIONS, SO THAT THE TERRORISTS
WERE ABLE TO REST UP AND COME BACK IN THE MORNING
REFRESHED.
THE SAME SOURCE CITES REPORTS FROM DIPLOMATIC
SOURCES IN KAMPALA THAT THE HIJACKERS WERE CALM THROUGH-
OUT, AND APPEARED CONFIDENT THAT THE UGANDAN TROOPS WOULD
NOT INTERVENE AGAINST THEM (AS, INDEED, THEY DID NOT).
11.  RELEASED HOSTAGES TOLD A REPORTER OF THE LONDON
OBSERVER, ACCORDING TO REUTERS (JULY 3), THAT UGANDAN
SOLDIERS, UNDER DIRECT ORDERS FROM AMIN, SUPERVISED THE
SEPARATION OF THE JEWISH FROM THE GENTILE PASSENGERS.
12.  ON AUGUST 10, 1975, IDI AMIN WAS QUOTED BY RADIO
KAMPALA AS TELLING OFFICERS AND ENLISTED MEN OF A
UGANDAN ARMORED BRIGADE THAT PLO LEADER YASSIR ARAFAT
HAD SENT PALESTINIAN ARAB PILOTS TO SERVE IN THE
UGANDAN AIR FORCE "IN MILITARY OPERATIONS IN AFRICA
AGAINST IMPERIALISM."
13.  THE PALESTINIAN NEWS AGENCY QUOTES THE "VOICE OF
PALESTINE" RADIO STATION (AUGUST 15, 1975) THAT
PRESIDENT AMIN HAD, ON AUGUST 13, MET WITH THE PALESTINIAN
PILOTS TRAINING IN UGANDA AND, IN THE PRESENCE OF TOP
UGANDAN ARMY OFFICERS, TOLD THEM THAT THEY WERE UNDER
HIS PERSONAL SUPERVISION.  HE ALSO USED THE OCCASION
TO EXPRESS HIS GOVERNMENT'S THANKS TO THE PLO FOR ITS
ASSISTANCE TO UGANDA.  THE SAME SOURCE ON OCTOBER 13
REPORTED THAT A "SUICIDE SQUADRON" OF PALESTINIAN AND
UGANDAN PILOTS HAD UNDERGONE TRAINING IN SOUTHERN UGANDA.
14.  EARLY IN AUGUST 1975, ARAFAT RECEIVED A TELEGRAM
FROM AMIN IN WHICH THE PRESIDENT OF UGANDA NOTIFIED
THE PLO LEADER THAT UGANDA HAD ALLOTTED 5,000 FEDAN
OF LAND TO BE CULTIVATED BY PALESTINIAN ARABS, THIS LAND
TO BE CONSIDERED PLO PROPERTY (MIDDLE EAST NEWS AGENCY,
CAIRO, AUGUST 8, 1975).
15.  THE SUNDAY TIMES OF LONDON SAYS THAT SOME 400
PALESTINIAN ARABS LIVE IN UGANDA, MOST OF THEM IN A
CAMP NEAR ENTEBBE.  THEY ARE EMPLOYED IN THE UGANDAN
ARMY AS MILITARY ADVISERS AND PILOTS, AND AS
BODYGUARDS FOR IDI AMIN.
16.  WE EXPECT ADDITIONAL AND MORE COMPLETE INFORMATION
TOMORROW AND WILL PROVIDE IT.  IN THE INTERIM, ADDRESSEES
SHOULD UTILIZE FIRST OPPORTUNITY TO PASS ON AS MUCH OF
FOREGOING INFORMATION AS MAY BE USEFUL.  CURRENT
EXPECTATION IS THAT SECURITY COUNCIL WILL BEGIN
CONSULTING JULY 7 ON OAU REQUEST FOR SC MEETING WHICH
IS NOW IN HANDS OF ITALIAN SC PRESIDENT, ALTHOUGH
FORMAL MEETING NOT EXPECTED UNTIL JULY 8.   ROBINSON

UGANDA RESCUE AND SECURITY COUNCIL --
ALTHOUGH MANY MEMBERS OF AFRICAN GROUP PREFER TO AVOID A
SECURITY COUNCIL SESSION ON THE UGANDA RESCUE, AGREEMENT WAS
REACHED THAT THE GROUP IS BOUND BY THE OAU DECISION IN MAURITIUS.
ACCORDINGLY, AFRICAN GROUP REQUESTED THE SC PRESIDENT (ITALY) TO

LEBANESE CRISIS --
ITALIAN CHARGE CAVAGLIERI REVIEWED WITH AMB BENNETT SEQUENCE OF
EVENTS SURROUNDING LEBANESE AMB GHORRA'S REQUEST TO HAVE HIS LETTERS
TO THE SECURITY COUNCIL PRESIDENT CIRCULATED. LEBANESE PRIME MIN-
ISTER KARAME HAS SENT TWO LETTERS TO THE SC PRESIDENT -- ONE THROUGH
EGYPTIAN AMBASSADOR AND ANOTHER THROUGH ITALIAN EMBASSY IN BEIRUT
-- WHICH STATE THAT CHAMOUN'S APPOINTMENT AS VICE PRESIDENT AND
MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND HIS DECISIONS IN THOSE CAPACITIES ARE
NULL AND VOID, AND THAT COMMUNICATIONS FROM LEBANESE AMB GHORRA SHOULD
BE DISREGARDED UNLESS APPROVED BY KARAME HIMSELF. AMB BENNETT EMP-
HASIZED THAT THE 30-YEAR PRACTICE OF CIRCULATING DOCUMENTS AS REQUEST-
ED BY MEMBER STATES ESTABLISHED PRECEDENT IN WHICH U.S. SETS GREAT
STORE.
CAVAGLIERE REMARKED THAT WAS NOT A "RIGHT," AND BENNETT COUNTERED
THAT A PRACTICE OF SUCH LONG DURATION DID INDEED TAKE ON ASPECTS OF
A "RIGHT," AND THERE WAS A FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE INVOLVED OF NOT ESTAB-
LISHING A PRECEDENT WHEREBY AN SC MEMBER COULD CHALLENGE ANY MEMBER
STATE'S REQUEST THAT HIS GOVERNMENT'S LETTERS OF DOCUMENTS BE CIR-
CULATED AS SC DOCUMENT.
USUN LEARNED THAT THE UN LEGAL COUNSEL OPINION ESSENTIALLY
SUGGESTS
THAT THE SC SHOULD DETERMINE IF THERE IS A CONTROVERSY. ACCORDING TO
THE LEBANESE MISSION, GHORRA DISCUSSED MATTER WITH UNDER SECRETARY
GENERAL GUYER WHO SAID THAT SECRETARIAT WAS IN A QUANDRY AS TO HOW
TO HANDLE KARAME'S LETTER. (CONFIDENTIAL -- USUN 2777, 2779)

TRUSTEESHIP COUNCIL -- MICRONESIA
GENERAL DEBATE ON MICRONESIA BEGAN IN THE TC JULY 6 WITH A
STATEMENT BY THE FRENCH REPRESENTATIVE. AT THE REQUEST OF
NAKAYAMA, OF THE CONGRESS OF MICRONESIA, THE TC AGREED TO
ISSUE AS AN OFFICIAL TC DOCUMENT THE TEXT OF THE MICRONESIAN
STATEMENT MAY 1 AT THE LAW OF THE SEA CONFERENCE. THE COUNCIL
ALSO TOOK NOTE OF SECRETARIAT REPORTS ON OFFERS BY MEMBER
STATES OF STUDY AND TRAINING FACILITIES FOR INHABITANTS
OF TRUST TERRITORIES (T/1776) AND ON DISSEMINATION OF
INFORMATION ON THE UN AND THE INTERNATIONAL TRUSTEESHIP
SYSTEM (T/1775). KRIENDLER SAID THE USG WAS ALERT TO THE
NEED TO HELP MICRONESIANS PREPARE FOR THE TERMINATION OF
THE TRUSTEESHIP AGREEMENT AND USDEL HOPED THE SECRETARIAT
WOULD CONSIDER HOW TO HELP MICRONESIANS ATTAIN THE TRAINING
NECESSARY FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH. HE URGED THAT MEMBER STATES
CONSIDER PROVIDING SCHOLARSHIPS. KOVALENKO (USSR) COMPLAINED
THAT INADEQUATE INFORMATION WAS AVAILABLE TO MICRONESIANS
CONCERNING SOVIET SCHOLARSHIPS AND STATED THE U.S. MUST MAKE
EFFORTS TO DISSEMINATE SUCH INFORMATION AS WELL AS INFORMATION
ON TC ACTIVITIES. THE FRENCH REPRESENTATIVE SUPPORTED THE
SOVIET CRITICISM.
GARRIGUE-GUYONNAUD (FRANCE) TOLD THE TC THAT FRANCE DID NOT
WISH TO OPPOSE THE CHOICE OF THE PEOPLE OF THE MARIANAS,
AND THEREFORE ENDORSED THE RESULTS OF THE PLEBISCITE. HE
SUGGESTED FORMULATING PROPOSALS THAT WOULD REMIND ALL
INHABITANTS OF THE ADVANTAGES OF UNITY FOR THE TERRITORY.
ON ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS, HE HOPED EFFORTS WOULD BE
MADE TO IMPROVE THE LIFE OF MICRONESIANS, SUCH AS SMALL ROADS,
OR A PIER, WHERE NEEDED. HE STATED EFFORTS SHOULD BE MADE TO
STRENGTHEN TRADE BETWEEN REGIONS RATHER THAN WITH DISTANT
AREAS, WHICH MIGHT ENCOURAGE DEPENDENCY; SUGGESTED EXACT NATURE
OF COMMONWEALTH STATUS ENVISAGED SHOULD BE KNOWN TO THE INHABITANTS
SO THEY COULD EXPRESS THEIR VIEWS ON IT; AND URGED THE U.S.
TO STRESS ECONOMIC AUTONOMY FOR MICRONESIA, GIVING PRIORITY
TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PRODUCTIVE SECTOR, AS WELL AS THE
POLITICAL EDUCATION OF THE INHABITANTS. (REPEATED INFO

COMMITTEE OF 24 SUBCOMMITTEE ON SMALL TERRITORIES --
THE SUBCOMMITTEE BEGAN CONSIDERATION OF AMERICAN SAMOA
AND THE NEW HEBRIDES JULY 6 AND HEARD STATEMENTS BY THE
REPRESENTATIVES OF THE U.S. AND THE UK.
KRESSLER STATED THAT THE MOST SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT ON
AMERICAN SAMOA HAD CENTERED AROUND THE QUESTION OF THE POPULAR
ELECTION FOR GOVERNOR AND LIENTENANT GOVERNOR. HE NOTED THAT
THE ISSUE HAD BEEN DEFEATED IN THREE REFERENDUMS BUT THAT
ANOTHER WOULD BE HELD AUGUST 31, SUPERVISED BY AN INDEPENDENT
ELECTION COMMISSIONER FROM OUTSIDE AMERICAN SAMOA. IF
THE PEOPLE VOTED AFFIRMATIVELY THE NEXT STEP WOULD BE DEVELOPING
OFFICIAL PROCEDURES FOR THE FUNCTIONING OF AN ELECTIVE GOVERNOR
UNDER THE PRESENT CONSTITUTION. HE REPORTED ON THE SERIOUS
EFFECTS OF THE ECONOMIC RECESSION, WHICH HAD NECESSITATED
STRICT ECONOMIES AND A REQUEST FOR A SPECIAL U.S. APPROPRIATION.
HOWEVER, THE ECONOMY WAS NOW BEGINNING TO SHOW SIGNS OF SLOW
BUT STEADY UPSWING, A NEW AND EXPANDED AIR SERVICE SHOULD
INFLUENCE TOURISM, AND AGRICULTURE WAS BACK TO NORMAL
FOLLOWING THE DROUGHT.
DALTON (UK), SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE UK AND FRANCE WHICH
JOINTLY ADMINISTER THE NEW HEBRIDES, READ PORTIONS OF A JUNE
29 JOINT STATEMENT CONCERNING THE POLICY OF THOSE TWO GOVERN-
MENTS TOWARD FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF THE TERRITORY. HE SAID
A FUNDAMENTAL STEP IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE TERRITORY'S
INSTITUTIONS WAS THE MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS AUG. 16, 1975,
THE FIRST HELD THROUGHOUT THE TERRITORY ON THE BASIS OF
DIRECT UNIVERSAL ADULT SUFFRAGE. PLANS WERE BEING DRAWN
UP TO RATIONALIZE THE JOINT ADMINISTRATION OF THE TERRITORY
WITH THE AIM OF ENSURING THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WAS CLOSELY
ADAPTED TO THE NEEDS OF THE NEW HEBRIDES, HE TOLD THE
SUBCOMMITTEE.

USCINCEUR | DEPARTMENT PRESS BRIEFING - JULY 6
FOR YOUR INFORMATION AND GUIDANCE FOLLOWING ARE EXCERPTS
FROM DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN'S PRESS BRIEFING JULY 6, 1976:
Q.  WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT A NUMBER OF THINGS ASSOCIATED
WITH THE ISRAELI COMMANDO RAID; NAMELY, HOW MANY AMERICAN
CITIZENS WERE INVOLVED?
A.  THE FIGURE I HAVE IS THREE AMERICANS, ONE OF WHOM IS
MARRIED TO AN ISRAELI.
Q.  DO YOU HAVE THEIR NAMES, PLEASE?
A.  MR. AND MRS. GEORGE KARFUNKEL.  I DO NOT HAVE AN AD-
DRESS ON THAT.  MRS. JANET ALMOG.  SHE IS MARRIED TO AN
ISRAELI.
Q.  ALL THREE ARE NOW IN JERUSALEM?
A.  I UNDERSTAND THAT MRS. ALMOG HAS RETURNED TO ISRAEL.
REGARDING THE KARFUNKELS, I AM NOT CERTAIN OF THEIR WHERE-
ABOUTS RIGHT AT THE MOMENT.
MR. BROWN:  THEY ARE ON THEIR WAY BACK TO THE UNITED
STATES?
MR. TRATTNER:  I THINK THEY WERE DUE TO RETURN TO NEW YORK
LAST NIGHT, AND I THINK NEW YORK IS THEIR HOME CITY.
Q.  KARFUNKEL'S HOME IS NEW YORK?
MR. TRATTNER:  I BELIEVE SO.
MR. BROWN:  WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS ACCURATE BUT WILL CHECK
FOR YOU, MURREY.
Q.  DO YOU KNOW MRS. ALMOG'S HOME?
A.  AS I SAY, SHE IS MARRIED TO AN ISRAELI AND IT IS MY
UNDERSTANDING SHE LIVES IN ISRAEL.
Q.  WERE THERE ANY AMERICANS AMONG THE HUNDRED AND THOSE
WHO DIED IN UGANDA?
A.  NOT AS FAR AS I KNOW.
Q.  ONLY THREE AMERICANS?
A.  YES.  THE OTHER AMERICANS ON BOARD THE HIJACKED AIR-
CRAFT WERE RELEASED IN THE INITIAL GROUP AS YOU RECALL.
AND I BELIEVE THE FINAL FIGURE WAS--I CANNOT GIVE YOU OFF
THE TOP OF MY HEAD THE FINAL FIGURE, BUT IT WAS AROUND
FIFTEEN.  AND I WILL GET YOU THE PRECISE NUMBER OF AMERI-
CANS RELEASED IN THE FIRST GROUP, AND IF THERE IS ANY
CHANGE FROM THIS FIGURE OF THREE WHICH I HAVE JUST GIVEN
YOU FOR THE RELEASE ON SATURDAY I WILL ADVISE YOU.
Q.  COULD YOU GO THROUGH THE SEQUENCE OF WHAT INFORMATION
YOU HAVE AVAILABLE AS TO WHAT THE UNITED STATES WAS
NOTIFIED ABOUT, WHEN IT WAS NOTIFIED, AND WHAT IT DID?
A.  MURREY, AS I UNDERSTAND IT, THE SECRETARY WAS TOLD OF
THE RAID AFTER IT HAD ALREADY STARTED.  THAT WAS ABOUT
6:00 P.M. SATURDAY EVENING, AND THAT WAS OUR FIRST KNOWL-
EDGE OF IT.
Q.  DO YOU KNOW AT WHAT POINT THE RAID WAS IN AT THAT
TIME?
A.  I DO NOT KNOW, MURREY.
Q.  IT WAS ABOUT 6:00 P.M. SATURDAY EVENING?
A.  YES.
Q.  WASN'T THE RAID OVER AND THE FLIGHT BACK, AT THAT
TIME?
A.  IT DEPENDS ON HOW YOU DEFINE "THE RAID".  PERHAPS THE
FLIGHT WAS IN PROGRESS BACK, BUT I AM TOLD THE RAID WAS
NOT YET COMPLETED AT THAT POINT.  BUT IT WAS ALREADY WELL
UNDER WAY, AT WHICH POINT THE SECRETARY WAS MADE AWARE
OF IT.
Q.  WE HAVE SOME DISCREPANCY HERE, WHICH IS WHY I AM ASK-
ING ABOUT THE TIME FACTOR, BECAUSE I UNDERSTOOD THE
ISRAELI EMBASSY TO SAY THAT THE SECRETARY, THE UNITED
STATES, WAS NOTIFIED AFTER THE PLANES TOOK OFF. AND THAT
WOULD BE A MATTER OF A CONSIDERABLY DIFFERENT TIME FACTOR
UNLESS THERE IS SOME MISUNDERSTANDING HERE.
A.  TOOK OFF FROM WHERE WOULD BE THE QUESTION.
Q.  I THOUGHT THEY MEANT AFTER THEY TOOK OFF FROM ISRAELI
TERRITORY.
A.  NO, I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT IS ACCURATE.  I CANNOT GIVE
YOU A MORE PRECISE TIME, MURREY, THAN ROUGHLY 6:00 P.M.
SATURDAY EVENING, AND THAT THE RAID WAS ALREADY IN
PROGRESS.
Q.  WHAT WAS THE FIRST INFORMATION THE UNITED STATES HAD
ABOUT THE RAID?
A.  I JUST SAID THAT IS OUR FIRST INFORMATION.
Q.  ALL RIGHT.  IS THE SITUATION THAT AMERICAN INTELLI-
GENCE HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE RAID BEFORE THE ISRAELI
EMBASSY NOTIFIED THE UNITED STATES?
A.  I AM NOT GOING TO GO INTO THE QUESTION OF INTELLIGENCE,
MURREY, BUT WILL REAFFIRM THAT OUR FIRST KNOWLEDGE OF THE
RAID BY THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE WAS APPROXIMATELY 6:00 P.M.
SATURDAY NIGHT.
Q.  I WOULD LIKE TO REPEAT MY QUESTION.  I WAS ASKING WHAT
THE FIRST KNOWLEDGE WAS OF THE UNITED STATES.
A.  I AM JUST GOING TO HAVE TO REPEAT WHAT I SAID, MURREY.
THAT IS OUR FIRST KNOWLEDGE OF IT.
Q.  ALL RIGHT, YOU ARE SAYING THAT UNITED STATES INTEL-
LIGENCE HAD NO ADVANCE KNOWLEDGE OF THE RAID?
A.  AS FAR AS I KNOW, IT DID NOT.
Q.  ALL RIGHT.
Q.  FRED, DOES THE QUESTION ARISE AS TO THE USE OF US-
SUPPLIED AIRCRAFT IN THIS RAID INTO UGANDA?  THOSE PLANES
ARE PROVIDED, AS I UNDERSTAND OUR LEGISLATION, SOLELY FOR
THE SELF-DEFENSE OF THE RECIPIENT COUNTRY.
A.  I IMAGINE THAT WOULD BE A SUBJECTIVE DETERMINATION.
I AM NOT INFORMED ON THAT, LARS.
Q.  DOES THE DEPARTMENT ALSO HAVE A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING
AS TO WHETHER UGANDA CONNIVED IN THE KIDNAPING OF THE
HOSTAGES?  THERE ARE CONFLICTING REPORTS AS TO WHETHER
UGANDAN TROOPS ACTUALLY STOOD GUARD OVER THEM.
A.  I DO NOT HAVE ANY CLEAR INFORMATION ON THAT POINT,
LARS.
Q.  I WAS HOPING WE WOULD BE ABLE TO GO THROUGH A TIME
SEQUENCE HERE IN ANSWER TO MY ORIGINAL QUESTION.  THE
UNITED STATES WAS NOTIFIED, YOU SAY, ABOUT 6:00 P.M.
SATURDAY EVENING.  WHAT DID THE UNITED STATES DO?
A.  I HAVE NO INFORMATION ON WHAT WE DID.  WE WERE PAS-
SIVE IN THE ENTIRE AFFAIR,  AND I DO NOT KNOW WHAT WE
WOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED UPON TO DO OTHER THAN TO RECEIVE
FURTHER INFORMATION.
OF COURSE WE WERE INTERESTED IN IT; IT WAS AN EVENT OF
INTERNATIONAL SIGNIFICANCE, AND, AS SUCH, WE FOLLOWED IT
ONCE WE WERE AWARE OF ITS TAKING PLACE.
Q.  I WOULD LIKE TO PURSUE THIS, IF I MAY.  DID THE UNITED
STATES INTERCEDE WITH KENYA IN ANY WAY?
A.  I HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF ANY INTERCESSION.
Q.  COULD YOU INQUIRE, PLEASE?
A.  WHAT IS YOUR QUESTION PRECISELY, MURREY?
Q.  MY QUESTION IS, DID THE UNITED STATES INTERCEDE WITH
KENYA IN ANY WAY TO FACILITATE THE EXIT OR THE REFUELING
OR ANY OTHER ACTIVITIES CONCERNED WITH THE ESCAPE ROUTE
OF THE ISRAELI COMMANDO PARTY?
A.  I THINK I HAVE ALREADY SAID, MURREY, THAT WE HAD NO
PRIOR KNOWLEDGE AND NO ROLE WHATSOEVER IN THIS AFFAIR, AND,
AS SUCH, I THINK IT FAIR TO SAY THAT WE WOULD NOT HAVE
INTERCEDED.
Q.  ARE YOU DECLINING TO TAKE MY QUESTION?
A.  NO, I AM NOT DECLINING TO TAKE YOUR QUESTION, BUT AS
WE HAVE STATED OVER THE WEEKEND IN ANSWER TO SIMILAR
QUESTIONS, THE UNITED STATES PLAYED NO ROLE WHATSOEVER
IN THIS INCIDENT.
Q.  WELL, WILL YOU TAKE THE QUESTION, PLEASE?
A.  I AM ALREADY GIVING YOU AN ANSWER.  I WILL BE
DELIGHTED TO TAKE THE QUESTION AS YOU POSED IT, BUT I AM
TRYING TO GIVE YOU AN ANSWER WHICH I THINK IS RESPONSIVE.
Q.  ALL RIGHT, LET ME PURSUE MY LINE OF QUESTIONING IF I
MAY.  WHAT WAS THE FIRST ACTION TAKEN BY THE UNITED
STATES?
A.  THE FIRST ACTION TAKEN WAS THE SECRETARY OF STATE
RECEIVING THE INFORMATION AROUND 6:00 P.M. SATURDAY
EVENING.
Q.  WHAT DID HE DO?
A.  I DO NOT KNOW.
Q.  WOULD YOU ATTEMPT TO FIND OUT, PLEASE?
A.  HE LISTENED.
Q.  WOULD YOU ATTEMPT TO FIND OUT WHAT ACTION WAS TAKEN
BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE WHEN HE RECEIVED NOTICE?
A.  I WILL ATTEMPT TO FIND OUT.
Q.  WAS THIS NOTICE FROM THE ISRAELIS?
A.  YES.
Q.  AT WHAT TIME DID THE UNITED STATES ISSUE ITS
STATEMENT?
A.  I  BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT SENT A LETTER TO MR. RABIN
ON JULY 4.  I DO NOT HAVE THE PRECISE TIME.  YOU MIGHT
ASK THE WHITE HOUSE.  THAT IS THE FOLLOWING DAY, SUNDAY,
JULY 4.
Q.  THERE IS NO FURTHER ACTION THAT YOU KNOW OF THAT WAS
TAKEN BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE?  HE SIMPLY RECEIVED THE
INFORMATION, AND THAT IS THE EXTENT OF YOUR KNOWLEDGE?
A.  THAT IS CORRECT.
Q.  A FOOTNOTE AT THIS POINT.  CAN YOU GIVE US SOME IDEA
OF HOW DETAILED A REPORT THE SECRETARY WAS GIVEN?
A.  I DO NOW KNOW.  I HAVE NO IDEA.
Q.  DO YOU, FOR EXAMPLE, KNOW WHAT ROUTE THE ISRAELI
PARTY TOOK --
A.  I DO NOT .
Q. -- ON THE WAY IN.
A.  ABSOLUTELY NOT.
Q.  YOU CAN'T TELL US THAT?
A.  NO.
Q.  WHO TOLD HIM, AND WHERE WAS IT?
A.  I UNDERSTAND THE ISRAELI AMBASSADOR CALLED THE
SECRETARY.
Q.  CALLED OR CALLED ON?
A.  CALLED, TELEPHONED.  THE SECRETARY WAS IN NEW YORK
AT THE TIME.
Q.  WAS THERE AN OP CENTER SET UP HERE IN THE COURSE OF
THIS INCIDENT?
A.  NO, AS FAR AS I KNOW, THERE WAS NO WORKING GROUP SET
UP.  I CAN CHECK ON THAT POINT FOR YOU, HOWEVER.
Q.  NOW THAT THE OPERATION IS OVER, CAN YOU TELL US WHAT
ACTIVITIES WERE ENGAGED IN BY THE STATE DEPARTMENT TER-
RORISM OFFICE?
A.  YOU MEAN THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE AFFAIR OF THE HIJACKING
OF THE AIR FRANCE AIRCRAFT WHICH BEGAN EARLIER IN THE
WEEK?
Q.  YES, PLEASE.
A.  I CANNOT GIVE YOU A DETAILED RUNDOWN ON THAT, BUT I
CAN CERTAINLY GET A DESCRIPTION OF WHAT THE OFFICE OF THE
SPECIAL ASSISTANT FOR COMBATING TERRORISM DID DURING THE
WEEK, IF YOU WOULD LIKE.
Q.  YES, I WOULD APPRECIATE THAT.
A.  THE UPDATES, THE INFORMATION THAT WE PROVIDED YOU DUR-
ING THE WEEK ON THIS MATTER WAS PROVIDED BY THAT OFFICE.
I THINK SOME OF YOU HAVE ALREADY CALLED MR. FEAREY'S OFFICE
DURING THE WEEK AND GOT WHAT INFORMATION WAS AVAILABLE.
Q.  I DIDN'T, BECAUSE, QUITE FRANKLY, MY RECOLLECTION WAS
THAT MR. FUNSETH ASKED FORBEARANCE OF THE PRESS IN RESPOND-
ING TO QUESTIONS DURING THAT PERIOD BECAUSE OF THE SEN-
SITIVITY OF THE OPERATION.
A.  YES, THERE WAS A LIMIT TO WHAT COULD BE SAID DURING
THAT VERY SENSITIVE PERIOD.
Q.  FINE.  NOW THAT THE OPERATION IS OVER, I WOULD HOPE
THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET A RECONSTRUCTION OF THE
EXTENT OF ACTIVITIES UNDERTAKEN BY THE OFFICE OF TERRORISM.
A.  I WILL BE GLAD TO ASK THAT OFFICE FOR A RECONSTRUCTION.
Q.  PICKING UP MURREY'S POINT, WAS THERE ANY POINT WHERE
THE US GOVERNMENT MADE AN APPROACH TO AMIN ASKING HIM TO
INTERCEDE ON BEHALF OF FREEING THE HOSTAGES?  OR DID WE
WATCH THIS AND DO NOTHING AND SAY NOTHING?
A.  I THINK YOU ARE RAISING TWO DIFFERENT THINGS.  I AM
NOT SURE WHETHER OR NOT ANY APPROACH WAS MADE BY THE US
GOVERNMENT DIRECTLY TO AMIN.  I WILL CHECK AND FIND OUT
FOR YOU RIGHT AFTER LUNCH.
Q.  WHAT ABOUT INDIRECTLY, FRED, THROUGH THE GERMAN
GOVERNMENT?
A.  YES, THERE WERE INDIRECT APPROACHES MADE, AS YOU KNOW,
BUT AS I TOOK BERNIE'S QUESTION, HE MEANT A DIRECT AP-
PROACH.  NOW, INDIRECTLY, AS WE SAID LAST WEEK, OUR POSI-
TION WAS MADE KNOWN BY THE FRG GOVERNMENT IN UGANDA, WHICH
REPRESENTS OUR INTERESTS THERE.  BUT I TOOK BERNIE'S QUES-
TION TO MEAN A DIRECT APPROACH, AND I WILL TRY TO FIND OUT
WHETHER OR NOT ANY WAS MADE.
Q.  WHAT IS THE POSITION OF THE UNITED STATES LEGALLY IN
THIS MATTER?  THE UNITED STATES DELIVERED A MESSAGE OF CON-
GRATULATIONS TO ISRAEL.  COULD YOU AMPLIFY OUR JURIDICAL
RATIONALIZATION?
A.  I THINK THE PRESIDENT'S STATEMENT CONTAINED IN THE
LETTER TO MR. RABIN SPEAKS FOR ITSELF.  I WOULD ONLY ADD
THAT INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM, AS A PHENOMENON, IS A
SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCE OF OUR MODERN AGE.  AND I WOULD POINT
OUT THAT FOR YEARS, THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN CALLING ON
THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO TAKE SPECIAL MEASURES TO
COMBAT IT.  AND I WILL JUST REFER YOU TO WHAT THE PRESI-
DENT HAS SAID ON THE MATTER, EXPRESSING HIS SATISFACTION
THAT THE PASSENGERS OF THE HIJACKED AIRCRAFT WERE SAVED.
Q.  WHAT I AM ASKING IS SOMETHING THAT GOES BEYOND THAT.
IT IS IN RELATION TO THE CHARGE MADE BY PRESIDENT AMIN
THAT THIS WAS AN ACT OF AGGRESSION.
A.  I AM NOT GOING TO HAVE ANY FURTHER COMMENT ON THE
MATTER, MURREY, EXCEPT TO REFER YOU TO THE ONE PRESIDENTIAL
STATEMENT THAT HAS BEEN MADE ALREADY.
Q.  YOU DON'T HAVE ANY FURTHER AMPLIFICATION FROM THE
STATE DEPARTMENT LEGAL OFFICE AS TO THEIR INTERNATIONAL
LEGAL INTERPRETATIONS?
A.  I DO NOT.
Q.  IN KEEPING WITH THE US POLICY OF NOT GIVING IN TO
RANSOM DEMANDS, DID THE UNITED STATES HAVE ANY COMMUNICA-
TION WITH ISRAEL BEFOREHAND, URGING THEM NOT TO GIVE IN?
A.  I AM NOT PRIVY TO WHETHER OR NOT SUCH COMMUNICATIONS
WERE EXCHANGED WITH THE ISRAELIS, BUT I WOULD POINT OUT,
AS WE HAVE SAID ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS, THAT WE DO NOT
FORMALLY GO INTO THE CONTENTS OF OUR DIPLOMATIC COM-
MUNICATIONS.
IN ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION, I AM NOT PRIVY TO THE EXISTENCE
OF ANY SUCH COMMUNICATION ON THAT SUBJECT.
Q.  FRED, I THINK YOU ARE PROBABLY NOT PREPARED TO
ANSWER THIS QUESTION, BUT IN VIEW OF THE SECRETARY'S
REPEATED SPEECHES ABOUT THE NEED FOR INTERNATIONAL ORDER
AND INTERNATIONAL LAW, COULD YOU TAKE THE QUESTION AS
TO WHETHER UGANDAN TERRITORIAL SOVEREIGNTY WAS VIOLATED
IN THIS RAID, WHETHER SUCH A VIOLATION, IF IT OCCURRED,
WAS JUSTIFIED BY THE CIRCUMSTANCES, OR WHAT OUR VIEW IS AS
TO THE ACT COMMITTED BY THE ISRAELIS; WHETHER IT CON-
STITUTED AN ACT OF AGGRESSION, VIOLATION OF SOVEREIGNTY,
JUSTIFIABLE OR NOT?
A.  I CAN CERTAINLY TAKE THE QUESTION, BUT I MUST COME
BACK TO WHAT YOU HAVE JUST SAID, NAMELY, OUR OFT-STATED
POSITION IS THAT, FOR YEARS, WE HAVE ARGUED IN THE INTER-
NATIONAL COMMUNITY FOR EFFECTIVE MEASURES TO COMBAT JUST
THIS KIND OF THING.  AND I WILL TRY TO GET YOU AN ANSWER
TO THE SPECIFIC QUESTION THAT YOU POSE.
Q.  I DON'T WANT TO BE CANTANKEROUS ABOUT THIS POINT, BUT
SIMPLY TO PURSUE THE SAME POINT THAT LARS MADE, THE LOGIC
OF THE POSITION THAT YOU SET OUT WOULD RAISE THE IMPLICA-
TION THAT THE UNITED STATES BELIEVES THAT THIS KIND OF
ACTION CAN BE REPEATED BY ANYONE ELSE, ANY OTHER COUNTRY,
UNDER SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF INEFFECTIVENESS OF THE INTER-
NATIONAL COMMUNITY TO COMBAT INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.  IS
THAT THE UNITED STATES PREMISE?
A.  I AM NOT GOING TO OFFER A JUDGMENT ON THAT.  IT SEEMS
TO ME YOU ARE THE ONE MAKING THE PREMISE, MURREY, AND I
WOULD NOT WISH TO BE PUT IN A POSITION OF HAVING TO CHOOSE
A YES OR NO ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION.
Q.  IS THERE AN ASSESSMENT IN THIS BUILDING OF THE EXTENT
TO WHICH THE UGANDAN GOVERNMENT COOPERATED WITH THE
TERRORISTS IN THIS INCIDENT, AS HAS CLEARLY BEEN ALLEGED
IN STATEMENTS FROM TEL AVIV?
A.  I DO NOT KNOW IF THERE IS A DEFINITIVE ASSESSMENT ON
THAT PARTICULAR POINT.
Q.  IS THERE AN OPINION?
A.  THERE ARE NO DOUBT OPINIONS AND SOME INFORMATION ON
THIS SUBJECT, BUT I AM NOT AWARE OF ANY DEFINITIVE
ASSESSMENT.  IT IS POSSIBLE THAT IT IS SOMEWHAT TOO EARLY
TO COME TO ANY KIND OF DEFINITIVE CONCLUSION ON IT.
Q.  CAN YOU TELL US WHAT THE THINKING IS?
A.  I REALLY CANNOT.
Q.  WAS ANY MESSAGE OF CONDOLENCE SENT TO THE UGANDAN
GOVERNMENT BECUASE OF THE DEATH OF SOME UGANDAN SOLDIERS
IN THE INCIDENT?
A.  I DO NOT KNOW.  I DO NOT KNOW OF ANY MESSAGE.
Q.  DO WE REGARD THOSE SOLDIERS WHO WERE KILLED AN IN-
NOCENT BYSTANDERS CAUGHT IN A FIREFIGHT, OR AIDERS AND
ABETTORS OF THE TERRORISTS, AND WHY HAVE WE NOT PUBLICIZED
ANY MESSAGE REGRETTING THEIR DEATHS?
A.  WE REGRET THE DEATH OF ANY INNOCENT BYSTANDERS IN AN
AFFAIR SUCH AS THIS.  HOWEVER, I MUST COME BACK TO THE
POINT THAT THE UNITED STATES WAS NOT INVOLVED IN WHAT
HAPPENED IN ENTEBBE.  WE HAD INNOCENT AMERICAN CITIZENS ON
BOARD AND WE OBVIOUSLY WERE VERY CONCERNED.  IN TERMS OF
EXPRESSING REGRET, WE HAD NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE DEATHS
OF THOSE TWENTY UGANDAN SOLDIERS, REGRETTABLE AS THOSE
DEATHS MAY BE.  BUT WE HAVE NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS
OCCURENCE.
Q.  IT WOULD APPEAR THAT BUT FOR THE SUPPLY OF THE THREE
C-130'S, THIS RAID MIGHT NOT HAVE TAKEN PLACE, AND THOSE
PLANES WERE SUPPLIED BY THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT.
SO I AM HAVING TROUBLE UNDERSTANDING HOW THE UNITED STATES
PLAYED NO ROLE IN IT.
A.  THE UNITED STATES SUPPLIES --
Q.  I MEAN, HAS NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE DEATH OF THOSE
UGANDANS.
A.  THE UNITED STATES WAS NOT FLYING THOSE AIRPLANES.
THE UNITED STATES HAS SUPPLIED C-130 AIRCRAFT, OR SIMILAR
AIRCRAFT, TO MANY COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD.  I WILL JUST
LEAVE IT AT THAT.
Q.  WHO, IN THE BUILDING, IS CHARGED WITH DETERMINING
WHETHER OR NOT ARMS SUPPLIED SOLELY FOR SELF-DEFENSE PUR-
POSES HAVE BEEN USED IN VIOLATION OF THE TERMS OF THOSE
ARMS SUPPLIERS?
A.  THE ULTIMATE RESPONSIBLE AUTHORITY IN THIS BUILDING
IS THE SECRETARY OF STATE.
Q.  IS HE THE RESPONSIBLE AUTHORITY WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT,
OR DOES THE PRESIDENT MAKE THE FINAL DECISION?
A.  I THINK IN SUCH A CASE IT MIGHT GO HIGHER THAN THE
SECRETARY OF STATE.  I AM NOT SUFFICIENTLY WELL INFORMED
ON THE PROCEDURE ON THIS, HOWEVER, TO GIVE YOU A FULL
REPLY.
Q.  WELL, AS A POINT OF CLARIFICATION, I WOULD LIKE TO
KNOW IF THERE IS A RESTRICTION ON THE USE OF C-130'S, AND
IF IN FACT THAT RESTRICTION WOULD APPLY ALSO TO THE C-130'S
RECENTLY SUPPLIED TO THE EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENT.
A.  AS I SAID AT THE BEGINNING, THIS IS A COMPLICATED
MATTER.  THERE WOULD BE QUESTION ON JUDGMENT INVOLVED.
AS I HAVE JUST SAID, THE ULTIMATE JUDGMENT IN THIS BUILD-
ING WOULD BE THAT OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE.
Q.  NO, I WAS ASKING A FACTUAL QUESTION; I WAS NOT ASKING
A JUDGMENTAL QUESTION.  THE FACTUAL QUESTION WAS:  ARE
THERE ARE RESTRICTIONS THAT WERE PLACED, FOR EXAMPLE, ON
THE RECENT SALE OF C-130'S TO EGYPT?  ARE THERE REALLY--
I DON'T KNOW THE FACTS.  THAT IS WHAT I WANT TO FIND
OUT.
A.  I DO NOT KNOW. YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THE RECENT SALE
OF C-130'S TO EGYPT?
Q.  YES, I AM.
A.  I DO NOT KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT, BUT I WILL FIND OUT
FOR YOU.
Q.  FRED, IS THE US GOVERNMENT, THROUGH ANY OF ITS
AGENCIES, PICKING UP ANY INFORMATION OF THREATS BY THE
PALESTINIANS BY WAY OF RETALIATION? IN OTHER WORDS, ARE
YOU GETTING AHYTHING THROUGH FBIS OR INTELLIGENCE SOURCES,
OR WHATEVER, THAT YOU HAVE PICKED UP,(A), AND (B), IF YOU
HAVE, HAVE YOU RELAYED IT TO ISRAEL AND TO ANYONE ELSE?
A.  I AM NOT AWARE OF ANY ON FBIS, BUT WE CAN CERTAINLY
CHECK THE RECENT RECORDS.  YOU SAY RETALIATION FOR THIS
PARTICULAR--
Q.  YES.
A.  I AM NOT AWARE OF ANY AT THIS TIME.
Q.  COULD YOU TAKE THAT ONE?
A.  YES.
Q.  EARLIER AT THIS BRIEFING, THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE,
THROUGH ITS SPOKESMAN, INDICATED THE UNITED STATES
PLAYED NO ROLE IN THIS INCIDENT.  DOES THAT INCLUDE
THE PLANNING AND PREPARATION OF THE RAID?
A.  THAT IS CORRECT.
Q.  DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING MORE ON THE SECRETARY'S FOREIGN
TRAVEL?
A.  NOTHING BEYOND WHAT WE BRIEFED YOU ON LAST WEEK--
NAMELY, A POSSIBLE TRIP AROUND THE FIRST WEEK OF AUGUST--
BUT THAT IS STILL UP IN THE AIR.  NO FIRM DATES YET SET.
Q.  IS IT THE IRAN TRIP?
A.  YES.
Q.  DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING IN THE SPECULATIVE GAZETTEER?

HEREIN FOLLOWS COMPLETE TEXT OF TANGOV STATEMENT AS CARRIED IN
"DAILY NEWS" OF JULY 6, 1976.
BEGIN TEXT:
1.  "THE GOVERNMENT OF UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA HAS BEEN SHOCKED
BY THE RECKLESS AND LAWLESS ACTION TAKEN BY THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT
USING ITS ARMED FORCES TO INVADE THE REPUBLIC OF UGANDA ON THE
DECLARED GROUNDS OF RESCUING THE HOSTAGES FROM THE HIJACKERS.
2.  "THIS ACTION CARRIED OUT AT ENTEBBE AIRPORT, UGANDA IN THE EARLY
HOURS OF JULY 4 CONSTITUTES A BLATANT VIOLATION OF THE SOVEREIGNTY
AND TERRITORIAL INTERGRITY OF AN AFRICAN STATE.  IT IS IN FACT
NOTHING SHORT OF AN ACT OF AGGRESSION AGAINST A MEMBER OF THE OAU
AND THE UN.
3.  "THE ISRAELI AUTHORITIES HAVE ATTEMPTED TO JUSTIFY THEIR ACTION
FOR
THAT GRAVE VIOLATION OF INTERNATIONAL LAW AND THE CHARTER OF THE
UNITED NATIONS, AS BEING MOTIVATED BY HUMANITARIAN CONSIDERATIONS
NAMELY THE RELEASE OF THE HOSTAGES FROM THEIR HIJACKERS.
4.  "BUT SUCH JUSTIFICATIONS ARE HOLLOW AND WITHOUT FOUNDATION
WHATSOEVER, THROUGH THIS ACTION THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT DOES NOT
ONLY BEAR FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE DEATH OF SO MANY UGANDAN
CITIZENS, IT IS ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATH OF SOME OF THE VERY
HOSTAGES IT SOUGHT TO SAVE.
5.  "THUS THIS ACT OF PIRACY DEMONSTRATES ISRAEL'S CALLOUS DISREGARD
FOR HUMAN LIFE AND PARTICULARLY THE LIVES OF SO MANY AFRICANS WHO
FELL UNDER THE BULLETS OF THE INVADING  ISRAELIS.
6.  "THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA CONDEMNS
THIS RECKLESS AND UNWARRANTED ISRAELI ACTION.  IT CONSIDERS
SUCH A VIOLATION OF THE SOVEREIGNTY OF AN AFRICAN STATE BY ISRAEL
AS A MATTER OF GRAVE CONCERN TO THE ENTIRE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
AND MORE PARTICULARLY TO THE OAU MEMBER STATES.  IN EXPRESSING ITS
OUT RAGE AGAINST THE ISRAELI INVASION OF UGANDA THE GOVERNMENT
IS NOT IN ANY WAY INSENSITIVE TO THE PLIGHT OF THE HOSTAGES - ISRAELI
S
AS WELL AS OTHERS WHO WERE TAKEN BY THE HIJACKERS.  IN FACT, TANZANIA
HAS FOLLOWED THEIR PREDICAMENT WITH GREAT CONCERN AND SYMPATHY.
7.  "WE HAVE ALWAYS MAINTAINED THAT SUCH ENDANGERING OF HUMAN LIFE
IS SOMETHING THAT MUST BE AVOIDED AND THAT NO EFFORTS BE SPARED TO
AVOID RECURRENCE OF INCIDENTS OF THIS NATURE.  IN THE PARTICULAR
CASE OF THE HIJACKED PLANE TO ENTEBBE, WE WERE CONCERNED AT THE
LIVES OF ALL HOSTAGES AND HAD HOPED THAT EVERYTHING WOULD BE DONE
SO THAT NO SINGLE LIFE IS LOST.  REGRETTABLY, ISRAEL'S IRRESPON-
SIBLE MILITARY ACTIONS HAVE FRUSTRATED OUR HOPES.
8.  "THE FLAGARANT VIOLATION OF A COUNTRY'S SOVEREIGNTY IS A MATTER
WHICH SHOULD CAUSE AN OUTRAGE TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  BUT
FOR AFRICA, ISRAEL'S ACTION HAS SERIOUS IMPLICATIONS.  THE FACT
THAT ISRAELI HAS COMMITTED THIS ACTION AGAINST AN INDEPENDENT
AFRICAN STATE SHOWS THE CONTEMPT THAT SHE HAS FOR AFRICA AND THE
AFRICAN PEOPLE.
9.  "FOR THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT ISRAELI CITIZENS HAVE FALLEN
VICTIMS OF HIJACKING AND OTHER ACTIONS.  IT HAS HAPPENED ELSEWHERE.
YET ISRAEL HAS NOT EVEN ONCE MOUNTED ANYTHING OF THIS NATURE
AGAINST THOSE COUNTRIES.  IT  IS THE CONTEMPT WHICH ISRAEL HAS
FOR THE SOVEREIGNTY OF AFRICAN STATES WHICH HAS PROMPTED HER TO
ACT IN SUCH AN ARROGANT AND LAWLESS MANNER.
AFRICA HAS TO DRAW THE NECESSARY CONCLUSIONS FROM THIS ACTION.
10.  OVER AND ABOVE THIS, THERE IS ANOTHER DIMENSION OF THE ISRAELI
OPERATIONS WHICH FREE AFRICA MUST NOT LOSE SIGHT OF.  THIS IS THE
CALLOUS AND ARBITRARY WAY AFRICA'S SOVEREIGNTY AND TERRITORIAL
INTEGRITY IS VIOLATED WHENEVER THE LIVES OF SOME WHITES ARE INVOLVED.
FOR THE ISRAELI AGGRESSION AGAINST UGAND EVOKES THE BITTER MEMORIES
OF THE MILITARY INTERVENTION IN STANLEYVILLE IN 1964.
11.  "THIS DANGEROUS PRECEDENT OF ARBITRARY VIOLATION OF AFRICA'S
SOVEREIGNTY BY THE ISRAELI AUTHORITIES MUST NOT BE TAKEN LIGHTLY.
FREE AFRICA HAS TO RIGHTLY RECOGNISE THAT THIS CHALLENGE AND
PROVOCATION AGAINST UGANDA IS IN FACT CHALLENGE AND GROSS
PROVOCATION AGAINST THE WHOLE OF AFRICA.  AFRICA MUST TAKE ALL
THE NECESSARY MEASURES AND PRECAUTIONS AGAINST A REPETITION OF
THIS HEINOUS CRIME FROM ANY QUARTER."  END TEXT

1.  MFA DEPUTY DIRECTOR GENERAL EVRON CALLED DCM EARLY JULY 4
(AMBASSADOR WAS EN TOUTE TO DEDICATION OF BICENTENNIAL NATIONAL
PARK) AND GAVE FOLLOWING FIRST DETAILS OF LAST NIGHT'S DRAMATIC
RESCUE OPERATION BY IDF FORCES AT ENTEBBE AIRPORT.  HE SAID
AMBASSADORS OF SEVERAL "FRIENDLY COUNTRIES" WERE BEING CALLED
IN THIS MORNING TO BE GIVEN THESE DETAILS.
2.  EVRON BEGAN BY SAYING THAT, WHILE HE KNEW WE WERE WELL AWARE
OF WHAT HAD BEEN GOING ON, HE WANTED TO EXPLAIN WHY THE GOI FELT
IT HAD HAD TO OPERATE AS IT DID.  FIRST, THEY HAD COME TO THE
CONCLUSION THAT IT WAS PROBABLY GOING TO BE IMPOSSIBLE TO REACH
AGREEMENT WITH THE HIJACKERS.  SECOND, THEY HAD TO TAKE INTO AC-
COUNT A "PROPER ESTIMATE" OF THE FRENCH INTERLOCUTORY ROLE.  THIRD,
THERE WAS THE OBVIOUS FACT THAT AMIN WAS WORKING HAND-IN-GLOVE
WITH THE HIJACKERS.  FOURTH, DEMANDS
WERE BEING MADE UPON ISRAEL TO PRESSURE OTHER COUNTRIES TO RE-
LEASE PRISONERS THEY WERE HOLDING, ALTHOUGH ONLY ISRAELIS WERE
BEING HELD HOSTAGE (OVERLOOKING, OF COURSE, THE AIR CREW).  FIFTH,
IF ISRAEL HAD GIVEN IN TO THE HIJACKERS DEMANDS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
ANOTHER BLOW AGAINST INTERNATIONAL SECURITY, AND A REWARD FOR IN-
TERNATIONAL BLACKMAIL.
3.  GIVEN THESE CIECUMSTANCES, ISRAEL HAD CONCLUDED THAT IT HAD TO
ACT.  THERE WAS NO INTENTION TO INTERFERE WITH OR HARM THE IN-
TERESTS OF ANY OTHER COUNTRY, EVRON STRESSED.  THE ONLY OBJECTIVE
OF THE ISRAELI TASK FORCE WAS TO SECURE THE SAFETY OF ISRAELI CIT-
IZENS.  THE AIR CREW HAD BEEN OFFERED THE OPTION OF DEPARTING WITH
THE ISRAELI TASK FORCE OR OF STAYING IN UGANDA.  THEY CHOSE TO
DEPART.
4.  EVRON SAID THAT TWO OF THE HOSTAGES WERE KILLED DURING THE FIGHT
AND THERE WERE SEVERAL CASUALTIES AMONG THE ISRAELI TASK FORCE.
NO PRISONERS WERE TAKEN AND HE BELIEVED THAT ALL THE HIJACKERS HAD
BEEN KILLED.  THERE WERE ALSO SOME UGANDAN CASUALTIES.  IN ALL,
HE THOUGHT THE NUMBER OF CASUALTIES WERE VERY FEW CONSIDERING THE
COMPLEXITY OF THE ENTIRE OPERATION.
5.  PRIME MINISTER RABIN WILL ADDRESS A SPECIAL SESSION OF THE
KNESSET THIS AFTERNOON.  THE MESSAGE HE RECEIVED FROM PRESIDENT
FORD DURING THE NIGHT WILL BE RELEASED AT 2 P.M. LOCAL TIME WHEN
RABIN IS SCHEDULED TO BEGIN SPEAKING.
6.  DCM ASKED ABOUT KENYAN COOPERATION.  EVRON DUCKED THIS BY
SAYING THAT HE HOPED TO GET TO US LATER ON THIS SUBJECT.  AS WE
COULD IMAGINE, HE ADDED, THE LESS SAID ABOUT THIS THE BETTER.
7.  COMMENT.  WHILE IT IS TOO EARLY TO ASSESS ALL THE MANY RAMIFI-
CATIONS OF THIS OPERATION, IT IS LIKELY TO BOOST THE DOMESTIC
STANDING
OF THE PRIME MINISTER AND HIS GOVERNMENT.  THE RESCUE OPERATION
IS PROBABLY THE GREATEST FILLIP TO ISRAELI MORALE SINCE THE YOM
KIPPUR WAR.   TOON UNQTE ROBINSON

 * 145857 1976NAIROB07002 0.007111771 | 1976-07-07 | NAIROBI | STATE | RENEWED KENYAN FEARS OF MILITARY ATTACK BY UGANDA
1.  PRESIDENTIAL PERMSEC KARIITHI SUMMONED ME TO HIS OFFICE
THIS AFTERNOON TO EXPRESS HIS HEIGHTENED CONCERN THAT
PRESIDENT AMIN PLANS TO ATTACK KENYA IN VERY NEAR FUTURE.
(HE HAD PREVIOUSLY EXPRESSED HIS CONCERN ON THIS SUBJECT
TO US ON JUNE 30, AS REPORTED IN REFTEL.)  KENYAN APPRE-
HENSION HAS NOW BEEN FURTHER REINFORCED BY RADIO UGANDA
ANNOUNCEMENT TODAY AT 0958 GMT (1258 LOCAL) THAT "30
ENEMY AIRCRAFT HAVE BEEN DETECTED BY UGANDA RADAR.  AIRCRAFT,
BELIEVED TO BE ISRAELI AND AMERICAN, WERE APPROACHING
UGANDA FROM KENYA."  UGANDA RADIO FURTHER ADVISED PUBLIC
"TO BE PREPARED TO DONATE BLOOD FOR EMERGENCY CASES", AND
ANNOUNCED THAT ALL MEDICAL SERVICES IN UGANDA SHOULD BE
ON STANDBY.
2.  KARIITHI SAID THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, COMING ON HEELS OF
MESSAGE TO PRESIDENT KENYATTA FROM AMIN LAST NIGHT DIRECTLY
ACCUSING KENYATTA OF HAVING FACILITATED ISRAELI HIJACK
RESCUE, IS TANTAMOUNT TO PUTTING UGANDA ON WAR FOOTING.
ALTHOUGH MEETING OF UGANDAN DEFENSE COUNCIL ON MONDAY HAD
VOTED 80 PERCENT AGAINST ATTACKING KENYA (AMIN WAS IN
MINORITY), AMIN IS APPARENTLY TRYING TO WIN OVER ARMY
TO SUPPORT HIM IN WAR ON KENYA, ACCORDING TO KARIITHI.
3.  EVEN MORE ALARMING TO GOK IS INTELLIGENCE REPORT THAT
TWO AIRCRAFT (BELIEVED TO BE EITHER LIBYAN OR SOVIET) LANDED
AT ENTEBBE AIRPORT AT 1000 LOCAL TODAY CARRYING AIRCRAFT
SPARES AND SOVIET TECHNICIANS.  KENYANS BELIEVE THAT THESE
SPARES AND TECHNICIANS WILL BE USED TO MAKE SOVIET-BUILT
UGANDA AIR FORCE PLANES LOCATED AT GULU, WHICH HAD BEEN
OUT OF COMMISSION FOR LACK OF PARTS, OPERABLE AGAIN.
KARIITHI BELIEVES ARRIVAL OF THIS ASSISTANCE MAY BE
IMPORTANT FACTOR IN ENCOURAGING AMIN'S BELLICOSITY.
4.  WHEN I ASKED WHETHER THERE WAS ANY NEW EVIDENCE OF
PLANS FOR UGANDAN GROUND ATTACK AGAINST KENYA, KARIITHI
REPLIED IN NEGATIVE, BUT MENTIONED THAT ONE UGANDAN
BATTALION LOCATED NEAR MBALE, ABOUT 30 MILES FROM KENYA
BORDER, HAD BEEN ON FULL ALERT AS OF TWO DAYS AGO.  I
ALSO ASKED WHETHER KENYA HAD RECENTLY CONSULTED WITH
TANZANIA ON THIS SITUATION AND WAS ALSO GIVEN NEGATIVE
REPLY.  KARIITHI FELT THAT, DESPITE NYERERE'S DISLIKE FOR
AMIN, KENYA COULD NOT EXPECT ANY SUPPORT FROM TANZANIA IF
UGANDA WERE TO ATTACK.
5.  AS PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE, KENYA DELAYING DELIVERY OF
MILITARY EQUIPMENT BELONGING TO UGANDA NOW IN PORT OF
MOMBASA.  IN ADDITION, KARIITHI SAID THAT GOK HAS INSTRUCTED
RAILROADS TO BE "A LITTLE SLOW" IN DELIVERING OIL TO
UGANDA, BUT WILL NOT COMPLETELY SHUT OFF OIL UNLESS WAR
SITUATION DEVELOPS.  PERMSEC OF DEFENSE KIERINI, WHO WAS
ALSO PRESENT AT MEETING, SAID THAT KENYA AREMED FORCES HAVE
AGAIN BEEN PLACED ON ALERT. (THEY HAD BEEN ON FULL ALERT
ON SUNDAY AND MONDAY AFTER ISRAELI RESCUE OPERATION, BUT
HAD BEEN TAKEN OFF ALERT ON TUESDAY).
5.  KARIITHI SAID THAT FOREIGN MINISTER WAIYAKI IS LEAVING
FOR NEW YORK TONIGHT FOR SECURITY COUNCIL MEETING ON
ISRAELI RESCUE OPERATION.  USUN WILL PRESUMABLY WANT TO
ESTABLISH CONTACT WITH HIM ASAP.

ANNEX
MESSAGE DATED 4 JULY 1976 FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE
REPUBLIC OF UGANDA
THE PRIME MINISTER OF MAURITIUS, CURRENT CHAIRMAN
OF THE ORGANIZATION OF AFRICAN UNITY,
PORT LOUIS,
MAURITIUS.
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL,
NEW YORK
THE SECRETARY-GENERAL,
UNITED NATIONS,
NEW YORK.
I WISH TO BRING TO YOUR URGENT ATTENTION THE MOST SERIOUS
INCIDENT WHICH OCCURRED AT ENTEBBA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT ON THE
NIGHT OF 3-4 JULY 1976.
AT 2120 GMT, THREE ZIONIST ISRAEL TRANSPORT PLANES LANDED BY
SURPRISE AND WITHOUT ANY AUTHORITY FROM THE UGANDA GOVERNMENT
AT ENTEBBE INTERNATIONSL AIRPORT. SOON AFTER LANDING THEY
PROCEEDED STRAIGHT TO THE OLD AIRPORT BUILDING, WHERE THE
HOSTAGES AND THE CREW OF THE FRENCH AIRBUS WHICH HAD BEEN
HIJACKED IN FLIGHT BETWEEN TEL AVIV AND PARIS WERE BEING HELD BY
PALESTINIAN COMMANDOS. TWO MILITARY JEEPS DROVE OUT OF THE
AIRCRAFT AND THE INVADERS, USING MACHINE-GUNS AND BAZOOKAS,
STATED SHOOTING INDISCRIMINATELY AT THE AIRPORT BUILDING AND
AT UGANDAN SOLDIERS WHO HAD SURROUNDED THE BUILDING AT A DISTANCE
OF 200 METRES AND WHO, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CONDITIONS LAID
DOWN BY THE HIJACKERS OF THE FRENCH PLANE, WERE ARMED ONLY
WITH LIGHT ARMS.
THE ISRAELI INVADERS QUICKLY MOUNTED AN ATTACK ON THE HIJACKERS,
KILLING SEVEN OF THEM AND SOME HOSTAGES, AS WELL AS A
NUMBER OF UGANDAN SOLDIERS, AND INJURING MANY OTHERS. THE
ISRAELI INVADERS ALSO BLASTED THE OLD AIRPORT BUILDING,
CAUSING CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE AND DESTROYING A NUMBER OF UGANDAN
AIRCRAFT, WHICH WERE PARKED NEARBY, AND OTHER EQUIPMENT.
YOU MAY WISH TO RECALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND THE SITUATION OF THE
AIRCRAFT THAT EXISTED SINCE THE HIJACKING DRAMA CAME TO UGANDA
AT 4:15 A.M. ON 28 JUNE, MOST NOTABLE OF WHICH WAS THAT THE
AIRCRAFT HAD FUEL FOR ONLY FIFTEEN MORE MINUTES. ON BEING
CONTACTED, I ALLOWED THE AIRCRAFT TO LAND AT ENTEBBE ON
HUMANITARIAN CONSIDERATIONS. AFTER THE LANDING, I TOOK THE
INITIATIVE, AS PRESIDENT OF THE REQUBLIC OF UGANDA AND THEN
CHAIRMAN OF THE ORGANIZATION OF AFRICAN UNITY (OAU), TO
NEGOTIATE THE RELEASE OF THE HOSTAGES. MY MAIN INTEREST ALL
ALONG WAS TO SAVE THE LIVES OF SOME 275 PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT
NATIONALITIES WHICH WERE AT STAKE. TO THAT END, I DIRECTED
THAT THE PLANE BE GUARDED PROPERLY WHILE I NEGOTIATED WITH
THE MEMBERS OF THE PFLP WHO WERE THE HIJACKERS OF THE PLANE.
MY FIRST SUCCESS WAS TO HAVE THE HOSTAGES REMOVED FROM THE
AIRCRAFT INTO THE AIRPORT BUILDING, A PROCESS WHICH WAS
ACHIEVED AFTER THE HIJACKERS HAD INSISTED FIRST OF ALL ON
PLACING EXPLOSIVES ROUND THE BUILDING BEFORE BRINGING THE
AEROPLANE NEARBY SO AS TO ENABLE THEIR HOSTAGES TO BE SECURELY
TRANSPORTED FROM THE AIRCRAFT TO THE BUILDING. AS WE HAVE
CLEARLY STATED IN VARIOUS COMMUNIQUES ON THE HIJACKING, THE
UGANDA ARMED FORCES WERE NOT ALLOWED BY THE HIJACKERS TO GO
NEAR THE AIRPORT BUILDING. THIS WAS PART OF THE BARGAIN.
HOWEVER, ONCE THEY WERE IN THE AIRPORT BUILDING, UNDER MY
DIRECTIVES, MANY FACILITIES, SUCH AS MEDICAL AND FOOD SUPPLIES
AND OTHER WELFARE TREATMENT WERE MADE AVAILABLE TO THE HOSTAGES,
WHILE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE HIJACKERS CONTINUED.
ON 30 JUNE 1976, THE PFLP ACCEPTED MY REQUEST TO RELEASE 47
HOSTAGES, INCLUDING OLD AND SICK PEOPLE AND SOME CHILDREN.
ON 1 JULY 1976, WHICH WAS THE FIRST DEADLINE SET BY THE
HIJACKERS, I WAS NOT ONLY ABLE TO CONVICE THEM TO EXTEND THE
DEADLINE TO 4 JULY, THAT IS, TODAY, BUT I WAS ALSO ABLE TO
MAKE THEM AGREE TO THE RELEASE OF ANOTHER 100 HOSTAGES WHO WERE
NATIONALS OF STATES OTHER THAN ISRAEL. IN ALL THESE DIFFICULT
NEGOTIATIONS I KEPT THE FRENCH AMBASSADOR TO UGANDA FULLY
INFORMED AND ALSO THE SOMALI AMBASSADOR TO UGANDA WHO, IN HIS
CAPACITY AS DEAN OF THE ARAB LEAGUE AMBASSADORS IN UGANDA,
HAD BEEN APPOINTED BY THE HIJACKERS TO BE THEIR SPOKESMAN.
ON THAT SAME DATE (1 JULY ), THE HIJACKERS GAVE THEIR
DEMANDS, WHICH WERE WIDELY PUBLICIZED AND TRANSMITTED TO ALL THE
GOVERNMENTS CONCERNED AS THE DEMANDS WERE ENTIRELY FOR THE
RELEASE OF A NUMBER OF PALESTINIAN FREEDOM FIGHTERS WHO HAD
BEEN IMPRISONED IN WEST GERMANY, SWITZERLAND, FRANCE AND KENYA,
AS WELL AS ISRAEL, IN ALL TOTALLING 53. ON 2 JULY 1976, I HAD TO
GO TO PORT LOUIS, MAURITIUS, TO HAND OVER THE CHAIRMANSHIP
OF THE OAU AT THE THIRTEENTH SUMMIT OF OAU HEADS OF STATE AND
GOVERNMENT. I TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY OF ADDRESSING MY COLLEAGUES
OF THE OAU ON THE SUBJECT OF THE DELICATE NEGOTIATIONS THAT I WAS
MAKING TO HAVE THE HOSTAGES AND THE FRENCH AIRLINER RELEASED.
I HAD TO RETURN TO UGANDA IN TIME FOR THE NEW DEADLINE OF 4
JULY, MADE BY THE HIJACKERS.
UPON MY RETURN, I QUICKLY RE-ESTABLISHED CONTACTS WITH ALL
PERSONS CONCERNED. I SPOKE TO THE HOSTAGES AND ASSURED THEM OF
MY EFFORTS TO DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO SAVE THEIR LIVES.
THE ISRAELI HOSTAGES THEMSELVES WERE VERY HAPPY WITH WHAT I
WAS DOING, WHICH IS PARTLY WHY, ON 3 JULY, THEY ISSUED A STATE-
MENT OF APPRECIATION FOR MY EFFORTS. THEY ALSO MADE AN APPEAL
TO THEIR GOVERNMENT TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF THE HIJACKERS SO THAT
THEIR LIVES WOULD BE SAVED. AFTER THE BRIEF MEETING WITH THE
HOSTAGES, I GOT IN TOUCH WITH THE FRENCH
AMBASSADOR THROUGH MY FOREIGN OFFICE TO CHECK ON WHETHER
THERE HAD BEEN ANY RESPONSE FROM HIS GOVERNMENT AND THE
OTHER GOVERNMENTS CONCERNED ON THE SUBJECT OF THE HIJACKERS'
DEMANDS. AS THE EXTENDED DEALINE WAS ONLY SOME 12 HOURS
AWAY, WHILE WAITING FOR THE INFORMATION, I CONTINUED MY
NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE PFLP COMMANDOS. THIS IS THE TIME WHEN
ISRAELI INVADING FORCES ARRIVED AT ENTEBBE.
I SHOULD LIKE TO BRING TO YOUR ATTENTION SOME ASPECTS OF THE
ISRAELI INVASION SHOWING THAT IT HAD BEEN WELL PLANNED AND
REHEARSED WITH THE  FULL COLLABORATION OF SOME OTHER COUNTRIES.
ACCORDING TO THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO US, WHICH HAS BEEN
REPEATEDLY CONFIRMED BY THE INTERNATIONAL PRESS, THE ZIONIST
ISRAELI PLAN TO INVADE ENTEBBA WAS DECIDED UPON ON THURSDAY,
1 JULY. THIS DECISION WAS COMMUNICATED TO THE KENYA
AUTHORITIES, WHOSE CONSENT AND ASSISTANCE IN THE OPERATION
WAS IMMEDIATELY OBTAINED.
THIS COLLABORATION HAS BEEN CONFIRMED BY THE FACT THAT THE
ISRAELI PLANES ON THEIR WAY TO AND FROM UGANDA STOPPED AT
NAIROBI WHERE, FOR EXAMPLE, A MOBILE OPERATING THEATRE WAS
SET UP TO TAKE CARE OF THE INVADERS' CASUALTIES. IT IS MOST
DISTURBING AND DISHEARTENING TO US IN UGANDA THAT SUCH A BLATANT
AND OPEN INVASION OF OUR COUNTRY SHOULD HAVE BEEN MOUNTED BY THE
ZIONISTS WITH THE CLOSE COLLABORATION OF KENYA, A NEIGHBOURING
SISTER STATE WHICH IS A MEMBER OF BOTH THE OAU AND THE UNITED
NATIONS. FURTHER ASPECTS OF THIS PLOT TO INVADE UGANDA HAVE
BEEN REVEALED BY THE INTERANTIONAL PRESS, NOTABLY THE VOICE OF
AMERICA - WHICH ANNOUNCED THE INVASION BARELY TWO HOURS AFTER
IT HAD BEEN MOUNTED - AND BY THE LEADING BRITISH SUNDAY
NEWSPAPERS, WHICH ARE CARRYING ON THEIR FRONT PAGES THE
DETAILS OF THE OPERATION. IT IS FURTHER REPORTED THAT THE
FOREIGN MINISTER OF ISRAEL IS TODAY, 4JULY, MAKING DIRECT
REPORTS ON THE INVASION TO THE AMERICAN SECRETARY OF STATE
AND TO THE FOREIGN MINISTERS OF FRANCE AND WEST GERMANY.
THESE ARE REPORTS CLEARLY REVEALING WELL PLANNED INTERNATIONAL
COLLABORATION IN A PLOT TO VIOLATE AND ABUSE THE TERRITORIAL
INTEGRITY OF UGANDA. THE HIJACKING INCIDENT, IN WHICH UGANDA
WAS ACCIDENTALLY INVOLVED AND ON WHICH I PERSONALLY SPENT
MANY SLEEPLESS DAYS, HAS THUS ENDED BY INNOCENT
UGANDANS LOSING THEIR LIVES AND PROPERTY ASIDE FROM THE
THOUSANDS OF SHILLINGS SPENT ON LOOKING AFTER THE HOSTAGES ON
HUMANITARIAN GROUNDS.
ON THE BASIS OF THE FOREGOING, I WISH TO IMPRESS UPON THE
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY THAT:
1. UGANDA HAS BEEN AGGRESSED BY ISRAEL WITH THE CLOSE
COLLABORATION OF SOME STATES, INCLUDING KENYA, A SISTER
NEIGHBOURING STATE;
2. THE AGGRESSORS HAVE KILLED A NUMBER OF UGANDANS, INJURED
MANY OTHERS AND DAMAGED A LOT OF PROPERTY, THE TOTAL COST
OF WHICH IS BEING ASSESSED;
3. IT IS THE INTENTION OF MY GOVERNMENT TO CLAIM COMPENSATION
ARISING FROM THIS AGGRESSION.
I REQUEST THAT THE  INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS FOR WHICH YOU
ARE THE RESPECTIVE SPOKESMEN, BE FULLY BRIEFED ON THIS
INCIDENT AND THAT ISRAEL BE CONDEMNED IN THE STRONGEST
POSSIBLE TERMS FOR THE AGGRESSION. IN THE MEANTIME, UGANDA
RESERVES HER RIGHT TO RETALIATE IN WHATEVER WAY SHE CAN TO
REDRESS THE AGGRESSION AGAINST HER.
HIGHEST CONSIDERATIONS,
(SIGNED) AL-HAJJI FIELD-MARSHAL DR. IDI AMIN DADA,
V.C., D.S.O., M.C.,
PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF UGANDA

SUMMARY: NPC CHAIRMAN CHU TEH DIED JULY 6, LEAVING THE
POLITBURO STANDING COMMITTEE WITH ONLY FIVE MEMBERS, INCLUDING
CHAIRMAN MAO. THE JULY 1 PARTY ANNIVERSARY EDITORIAL
REFLECTED DIFFERENCES IN THE LEADERSHIP ON HOW TO CARRY OUT
THE ANTI-CAPITALIST ROADER CAMPAIGN WHILE OTHER ARTICLES
HAVE INDICATED AN UPSURGE IN CALLS FOR ACTION TO EXPAND THE
CAMPAIGN TARGETS. EXTERNALLY, FOREIGN TRADE MINISTER LI
CHIANG BECAME THE FIRST PRC MINISTER TO ATTEND A FOURTH OF
JULY RECEPTION. PRC DOMESTIC MEDIA HAVE THUS FAR AVOIDED
COMMENT ON THE ISRAELI COMMAND ACTION IN UGANDA AND ON THE
EUROPEAN COMMUNIST SUMMIT CONFERENCE, ALTHOUGH THE LOCAL
PRC MEDIA HAVE REPORTED EXTENSIVELY ON BOTH EVENTS. FEW
COMMUNIST PARTIES HAVE CONGRATULATED THE CCP ON ITS 55TH
ANNIVERSARY, BUT ALL OF THE SOUTHEAST ASIA INSURGENT
PARTIES, EXCEPT FOR THE PHILIPPINES, HAVE DONE SO. END
SUMMARY
1. CHU TEH DIES
THE DEATH JULY 6 OF MARSHAL CHU TEH, POLITBURO STANDING
COMMITTEE MEMBER, CHAIRMAN OF THE NPC STANDING COMMITTEE
AND COMMANDER OF THE COMMUNIST TROOPS DURING THE CIVIL WAR
YEARS, LEAVES THE STANDING COMMITTEE WITH ONLY FIVE MEMBERS.
IT ALSO REMOVES FROM THE POLITBURO ONE OF THE STAUNCHEST
DEFENDERS OF THE OLD GUARD, A MAN WHO IS REPORTED TO HAVE
OPPOSED TENG HSIAO-PING'S DISMISSAL EARLIER THIS YEAR. WITH
CHU GONE, AGING DEFENSE MINISTER YEH CHIEN-YING IS THE ONLY
PRE-CULTURAL REVOLUTION FIGURE, OTHER THAN MAO HIMSELF, WHO
REMAINS ON THE STANDING COMMITTEE (HONG KONG 7898). CONFIDENTIAL
2. PARTY DAY EDITORIAL AND PROVINCIAL REACTION
THE FIRST JOINT EDITORIAL BY THE PRC'S THREE LEADING PUBLICA-
TIONS IN THE ANTI-TENG CAMPAIGN, COMMEMORATING THE 55TH
ANNIVERSARY OF THE JULY 1 FOUNDING OF THE CHINESE COMMUNIST
PARTY, REFLECTS TENSIONS WITHIN THE LEADERSHIP OVER HOW TO
HANDLE THE CAPITALIST-ROADERS WITHIN THE PARTY. A 1964 MAO
QUOTE IS PRINTED FOR THE FIRST TIME, AND IT IS A POTENTIALLY
CONTENTIOUS ONE. IN A DIRECTIVE CONCERNING THE SOCIALIST
EDUCATION MOVEMENT, A FORERUNNER OF THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION,
MAO CLAIMED THAT THE BUREAUCRATICCLASS AND WORKING CLASS
WERE "SHARPLY ANTAGONISTIC TO EACH OTHER" AND THAT PARTY
CAPITALIST-ROADERS WERE "BOURGEOIS ELEMENTS SUCKING THE BLOOD
OF THE WORKERS." INSTEAD OF CALLING FOR THE OUSTER OF
PRESENT-DAY CAPITALIST-ROADERS, HOWEVER, THE EDITORIAL
STATES THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION TO SOLVE IS THAT OF
LINE, AND IT INVOKES MAO'S DICTUM ON CURING THE SICKNESS
TO SAVE THE PATIENT AS THE PRINCIPLE TO BE APPLIED TO THOSE
COMRADES WHO HAVE MADE MISTAKES. THIS IS THE FIRST USE OF
THAT FORMULATION IN AN EDITORIAL SINCE MARCH 10 (HONG KONG
7746). LIMITED OFFICIAL USE
3. CENTRAL INSTRUCTIONS TO THE PROVINCES ON THE STUDY OF
THE EDITORIAL APPEAR TO HAVE EMPHASIZED MAO'S 1964 DIRECTIVE
ON THE SOCIALIST EDUCATION MOVEMENT. AN ANHWEI BROADCAST
JULY 2 CALLS MAO'S DIRECTIVE THE "CORE OF THE EDITORIAL"
WHILE A KIANGSU BROADCAST OF THE SAME DATE REFERS TO MAO'S
DIRECTIVE AS THE "MOST IMPORTANT THING" IN THE EDITORIAL.
WHILE ONLY TROUBLED CHEKIANG HAS THUS FAR REPEATED THE
EDITORIAL'S FORMULA ON CURING THE SICKNESS TO SAVE THE PATIENT,
SEVERAL HAVE STRESSED STUDY AND CONCENTRATION ON THE CORRECT
LINE AS THE PROPER PLAN FOR ACTION. THUS, WHILE MAO'S 1964
DIRECTIVE COULD BE USED AS A JUSTIFICATION FOR SOME FUTURE
CHANGES IN PROVINCIAL PARTY STRUCTURES, FOR THE MOMENT MOST
PROVINCIAL REACTION HAS PLACED EQUAL EMPHASIS ON THE BLANDER
ASPECTS OF THE EDITORIAL. LIMITED OFFICIAL USE
4. TO PURGE OR NOT TO PURGE . . . .
WHILE THE JOINT EDITORIAL WOUND UP ON A MODERATE NOTE, A
JUNE 30 PEOPLE'S DAILY ARTICLE ON TSINGHUA UNIVERSITY, ALSO
CARRIED IN NCNA, APPEARS TO OFFER UP A BLUEPRINT FOR ACTION
LACKING IN THE EDITORIAL. THE NCNA ITEM STATES THAT
TSINGHUA UNIVERSITY'S PARTY COMMITTEE HAS EXPELLED "RENEGADES,
ENEMY AGENTS AND COUNTERREVOLUTIONARIES" WHILE ADMITTING
INTO THE PARTY ACTIVISTS WHO DARE TO FIGHT THE CAPITALIST-
ROADERS. SIMILARLY, A JULY 2 PEOPLE'S DAILY ARTICLE BY
"LIANG HSIAO" CALLS FOR PURGING ENEMIES WITHIN THE PARTY
AND APPLAUDS THE PARTY'S PAST LAUNCHING OF MASS STRUGGLE.
ON THE OTHER HAND, THE ARTICLE STRIKES A DEFENSIVE NOTE IN
CLAIMING THAT THOSE "GETTING TIRED OF CLASS STRUGGLE" ARE
PLAYING INTO THE HANDS OF THE CAPITALIST-ROADERS AND THAT
THE THEORY OF AN INEVITABLE CAPITALIST RESTORATION "IS
EXTREMELY REACTIONARY" (PEKING 1TLM LIMITED OFFICIAL USE

5. SHANGHAI MEDIA HAVE ALSO ENTERED THE FRAY WITH A WEN
HUI PAO ARTICLE JUNE 28 WHICH APPEARS TO JUSTIFY FACTIONALISM
BY POINTING OUT THAT A GROUP OF PARTY MEMBERS WITH "PROLETARIAN
PARTY CHARACTER" IS NEEDED WHO ARE UNAFRAID TO STRUGGLE
AGAINST CAPITALIST-ROADERS. MEANWHILE, A CHIH HENG ARTICLE
IN THIS MONTH'S RED FLAG ALSO LABORS TO JUSTIFY CLASS STRUGGLE
WITHIN THE PARTY. WHILE REPEATING MAO'S "SAVE THE PATIENT"
FORMULA, CHIH HENG ALSO QUOTES MAO ON PURGES: "A PROLETARIAN
PARTY MUST ALSO GET RID OF THE STALE AND TAKE IN THE FRESH,
FOR ONLY THUS CAN IT BE FULL OF VITALITY. WITHOUT ELIMINATING
WASTE MATTER AND ABSORBING FRESH BLOOD THE PARTY HAS NO VIGOR."
THUS, AS IF IN REACTION TO THE BALANCED TONE OF THE JOINT
EDITORIAL, THE PAST WEEK HAS WITNESSED AN UPSURGE OF LESS
AUTHORITIATIVE ARTICLES CALLING FOR ACTION TO EXPAND CAMPAIGN
TARGETS WITHIN THE QRTY (HONG KONG 7746). LIMITED OFFICIAL USE
6. UNITED STATES
THE AMERICAN BICENTENNIAL CELEBRATION AT USLO WAS ATTENDE
BY FOREIGN TRADE MINISTER LI CHIANG, THE FIRST TIME A PRC
MINISTER HAD ATTENDED A JULY 4 PARTY. FOUR VICE MINISTERS,
INCLUDING WANG HAI-JUNG, ALSO ATTENDED. (PEKING 1203)
OTHER US ITEMS REPORTED BY NCNA DURING THE WEEK WERE PRIMARILY
ON ECONOMIC AND MILITARY ISSUES WITH SHORT ARTICLES ON THE
UNEMPLOYMENT INCREASE DURING JUNE AND SENATE PASSAGE OF THE
PUBLIC DEBT CEILING INCREASE. SLIGHTLY LONGER ITEMS REPORTED
THE PRESIDENT'S SIGNING OF THE FOREIGN MILITARY AID BILL
AND CONGRESSIONAL PASSAGE OF THE MILITARY PROCUREMENT BILL.
IN BOTH ARTICLES, NCNA INDICATED THE NEED FOR THESE INCREASED
EXPENDITURES BECAUSE OF SOVIET MILITARY EXPANSION (NCNA,
JULY 1-4). LIMITED OFFICIAL USE
7. SOVIET UNION
THE FOCUS OF NCNA REPORTING ON THE SOVIETS DURING THE WEEK
WAS EUROPE. NCNA CARRIED EXCERPTS FROM THE JULY 1 DANISH
PROTEST TO THE USSR ON OBSTRUCTION OF DANISH NAVAL EXERCISES,
THEN FOLLOWED UP WITH AN NCNA COMMENTARY ON THE MATTER.
SIMILARLY, NCNA CARRIED A REPORT ON THE FRG RESPONSE TO THE
MAY 22 USSR STATEMENT ON SOVIET-GERMAN RELATIONS (WR 23).
ANOTHER ARTICLE DWELT ON THE "FAILURE" OF THE HELSINKI
CONFERENCE, MAINTAINING THAT THE SOVIETS SINCE THEN HAVE
INCREASED THEIR MILITARY DEPLOYMENT AS WEILL AS INTENSIFIED
THEIR POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC SUBVERSIVE ATTEMPTS AGAINS
WESTERN EUROPE. FOLLOWING UP ON THE AUSTRALIAN PRIME
MINISTER'S RECENT VISIT TO PEKING, AN NCNA CORRESPONDENT'S
ARTICLE MAINTAINED THAT "WE DISLIKE RUSSIA IS A REMARK
FREQUESTLY EXPRESSED IN AUSTRALIA TODAY." TURNING TO AFRICA,
NCNA REPLAYED SOVIET AGGRESSION IN ANGOLA AND SOVIET-EGYPTIAN
DIFFICULTIES AS EVIDENCE THAT THE SOVIETE ARE THE "WICKED
ENEMY" OF THE AFRICAN PEOPLES. FINALLY, A LENGTHY NCNA
CORRESPONDENT ARTICLE CONDEMNED THE SOVIET MILITARY BUILD-UP,
CLAIMING THE SOVIETS HAVE ALREADY OUTSTRIPPED THE USE IN
CONVENTIONAL ARMS AND HAVE CREATED AN "OCEAN-GOING OFFENSIVE.Z
MAINTAINING THAT MOSCOW IS "FOLLOWING IN THE WAKE OF BOTH
TSARIST RUSSIAN IMPERIALISM AND HITLER," THE ARTICLE ENDS BY
ASSERTING THAT SOVIET POLICY IS "OUT AND OUT HEGEMONISM."
(NCNA, JUNE 29-JULY 6) LIMITED OFFICIAL USE
8. COMMUNIST PARTIES
ALTHOUGH THE PRC DOMESTIC MEDIA HAVE REFRAINED FROM MENTIONING
THE EUROPEAN COMMUNIST CONFERENCE, THE LOCAL WEN WEI PAO
JULY 2 COMMENTED THAT THE RESULTS PROVED THE "TOTAL BANK-
RUPTCY OF SOVIET REVISIONIST HEGEMONISM" AMONG THE EUROPEAN
COMMUNIST PARTIES. THE LOCAL PAPERS ALSO NOTED THAT THE
CONFERENCE OPENED WHILE POLISH WORKERS WERE ON STRIKE PRO-
TESTING FOOD PRICE HIKES WHICH WERE ALSO THE SUBJECT OF A
LENGTHY SIGNED NCNA ARTICLE. NCNA INDICATED THAT THE POLISH
WORKERS FORCED WITHDRAWAL OF THE PRICE INCREASES, BUT MAINTAINED
THAT THE SOVIETS THROUGH THEIR PLUNDER OF THE POLISH ECONOMY
BORE THE REAL RESPONSIBILITY. NCNA ALSO CARRIED REPORTS
FROM ALBANIA AND THE FRENCH MARXIST-LENINIST COMMUNIST
PARTY ON THE POLISH STRIKES (NCNA, JULY 3; TA KUNG PAO,
JUNE 28; WEN WEI PAO, JULY 2). LIMITED OFFICIAL USE
9. THE PAUCITY OF SUPPORT FOR THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY,
HOWEVER, HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED BY THE RELATIVELY FEW CON-
GRATULARTROY GREETINGS ON THE 55TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CCP.
THUS FAR, NCNA HAS CARRIED MESSAGES ONLY FROM PARTIES IN
LAOS, THAILAND, BURMA, INDONESIA, MALAYSIA, VIETNAM, ALBANIA,
NORTH KOREA, POLAND (FROM THE RUMP MARXIST-LENINIST GROUP
HEADQUARTERED IN ALBANIA), ROMANIA, GERMANY, AND THE US
OCTOBER LEAGUE. THE BULK OF THE MESSAGES WERE LIMITED TO
PRAISE FOR PRC ACHIEVEMENTS AND FOR CHAIRMAN MAO'S LEADER-
SHIP. UNDOUBTEDLY OF SOME CONCERN TO THE SOUTHEAST ASIAN
COUNTRIES WERE THE COMMENTS INCLUDED IN THE INDONESIAN, THAI,
AND MALAYSIAN GREETINGS. THE RESIDENT INDONESIAN COMMUNIST
IN PEKING, JUSUF ADJITOROP, MAINTAINED THAT THE CCP
"RESOLUTELY SUPPORTS AND ASSISTS THE INDONESIAN COMMUNIST
PARTY AND THE INDONESIAN REVOLUTION," WHICH HE DESCRIBED
AS "FIGHTING FOR THE OVERTHROW OF THE SUHARTO FASCIST
MILITARY DICTATORSHIP WHICH IS A LACKEY OF US IMPERIALISM
AND HAS THE BACKING OF SOVIET SOCIAL-IMPERIALSIM." THE
THAI CENTRAL COMMITTEE INDICATED THEY WOULD CONTINUE FOLLOW-
ING MAO'S MAXIM ON ENCIRCLING THE CITIES AND SEIZING STATE
POWER BY ARMED FORCE. THE MALAYSIANS CLAIMED TO HAVE
"ESTABLISHED CLOSE REVOLUTIONARY UNIT AND A PROFOUND
MILITANT FRIENDSHIP WITH THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHINA AND
THE CHINESE PEOPLE." SUCH COMMENTS CARRIED BY NCNA SHOULD
DO LITTLE TO IMPROVE PRC FORMAL GOVERNMENTAL RELATIONSHIPS
WITH THE COUNTRIES CONCERNED (NCNA, JULY 1-6). LIMITED

10. AFRICA
AS HIS PREDECESSOR HAS DONE, PREMIER HUA KUO-FENG SENT A
MESSAGE EXTENDING "WARMEST CONGRATULATIONS" ON BEHALF OF THE
CHINESE GOVERNMENT AND PEOPLE TO THE LATEST OAU SUMMIT
SESSION. THE JULY 1 MESSAGE, INTER ALIA, EXPRESSED THE HOPE
THAT THE CURRENT ASSEMBLY WOULD MAKE A NEW CONTRIBUTION TO
FURTHER STRENGTHENING OF AFRICAN "MILITANT UNITY." A JULY 16
NCNA REPORT ON THE CLOSING CEREMONY CITED PORTIONS OF THE
SPEECH FROM THE HOST COUNTRY CHAIRMAN, MAURITIUS PRIME MINISTER
RAMGOOLAM, WHICH TENDED TO PUT A POSITIVE CAST ON THE ASEMBLY
DELIBERATIONS. IT NOTED THAT THE OAU ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
EMPHASIZING INTENSIFIED ARMED STRUGGLE IN AFRICA, STRONGLY
CONDEMNING SOUTH AFRICA FOR THE SOWETO MASSACRES AND THE
ISRAELIS' "WANTON AGGRESSION" AGAINST UGANDA. BUT WITH THE
CHINESE CURRENTLY VIEWING AFRICA UNITY AS THE OPTIMUM MEANS
OF COUNTERING SOVIET INROADS IN AFRICA, PEKING IS UNDOUBTEDLY
DISAPPOINTED WITH THE SUMMIT'S OUTCOME, WHICH DEEPENS RATHER
THAN DIMINISHES DIVISIONS AMONG THE AFRICAN NATIONS AND
BETWEEN AFRICAN AND ARAB COUNTRIES. LIMITED OFFICIAL USE
11. IN CONTRAST WITH THE SILENCE OF PRC DOMESTIC NEWS
ORGANS ON RECENT EVENTS IN UGANDA, HONG KONG'S COMMUNIST
PRESS HAS CARRIED A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF WIRE SERVICE
REPORTS ON THE ISRAELI RESCUE OF HOSTAGES BEING HELD BY
THE PALESTINIAN HIJACKERS. A JULY 6 WEN WEI PAO COMMENTARY
SHARPLY DENOUNCED THE ISRAELI RESCUE AS AN "ACT OF AGGRESSION."
IT DECLARED THAT EACH COUNTRY HAS THE RIGHT TO HANDLE
HIJACKERS IN ITS OWN WAY. ISRAELI ASSERTIONS THAT THEIR
ACTION WAS "REASONABLE AGGRESSION" WERE TERMED "PIRATE'S
LOGIC." THE COMMENTARY CONCLUDED BY LINKING THE ISRAELIS'
DECISION TO UNDERTAKE AN ACTION THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY FROM
HOME WITH SUPPORT FROM THE TWO SUPERPOWERS.
12. FINALLY, DURING THE WEEK NCNA CARRIED TWO REPORTS ON
THE FAILURE OF THE MILITARY COUP AGAINST THE SUDANESE
PRESIDENT NIMERI. THE BRIEF NEWS REPORTS AVOIDED MENTIONING
LIBYA BY NAME, BUT DID CITE PRESIDENT NIMERI'S CHARGES OF
FOREIGN AGGRESSION AND INVOLVEMENT IN THE COUP ATTEMPT
(HONG KONG 7882 AND NCNA, JULY 6). LIMITED OFFICIAL USE
13. VIETNAMESE REUNIFICATION
CHINA'S RESPONSE TO EVENTS ASSOCIATED WITH VIETNAM'S OFFICIAL
REUNIFICATION HAS HIGHLIGHTED THE COOL BUT CORRECT RELATION-
SHIP BETWEEN PEKING AND HANOI. PRC MEDIA ON JULY 3 CARRIED
THE TEXT OF A JOINT CONGRATULATORY MESSAGE FROM CHAIRMAN MAO,
NPC CHAIRMAN CHU TEH AND PREMIER HUA KUO-FENG TO THE NEWLY
ELECTED VIETNAMESE PARTY AND GOVERNMENT LEADERS. THE RATHER
LUKEWARM MESSAGE AND A SUBSEQUENT JULY 4 PEOPLE'S DAILY
EDITORIAL FAILS TO MENTION FRATERNAL FRIENDSHIP, GOVERNMENT-
TO-GOVERNMENT TIES, OR PARTY-TO-PARTY SUPPORT. ALTHOUGH
SOMEWHAT WARMER IN TONE, THE EDITORIAL MERELY STATES THAT
THE CHINESE PEOPLE SHARE THE JOY OF THE VIETNAMESE PEOPLE
AND EXTEND CONGRATULATIONS. NCNA HAS ALSO REPORTED THE
MEETING OF FONMIN CHIAO KUAN-HUA WITH THE VIETNAMESE AMBASSADOR
TO PEKING. THE AMBASSADOR PRESENTED AN OFFICIAL NOTE INFORM-
ING CHINA OF THE NEW SOCIALIST REPUBLIC'S DESIRE TO CONTINUE
DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH THE PRC IN PLACE OF THE TWO PREVIOUS
VIETNAMESE EMBASSIES. LATER, ON JULY 6, FOREIGN TRADE
MINISTER LI CHIANG WAS THE RANKING PRC OFFICIAL ON HAND AT
A FILM RECEPTION HOSTED BY THE VIETNAMESE AMBASSADOR TO MARK
VIETNAM'S REUNIFICATION (HONG KONG 7873 AND NCNA, JULY 6).

 * 75237 1976GENEVA05293 0.00710166 | 1976-07-06 | GENEVA | STATE | UNDP 22ND GOVERNING COUNCIL - FINAL SESSION
1.  SUMMARY:  THE DRAFT REPORT OF 22ND SESSION OF
UNDP GOVERNING COUNCIL WAS ADOPTED AT 6:30 P.M. 5 JULY
AFTER FOUR HOURS OF DEBATE THAT WAS MARKED BY: 1)
A RESERVATION BY THE ISRAELI OBSERVER POINTING OUT THAT
UNDER THE PARTICIPANT FORMULA PROPOSED FOR THE
TECHNICAL COOPERAION AMONG DEVELOPING COUNTRIES WORLD
CONFERENCE (WHICH WAS THE PARTICIPANT FORMULA USED FOR
THE RECENT HABITANT CONFERENCE) THE PLO WOULD BE
PERMITTED TO ATTEND AND TTO ONCE AGAIN JEOPARDIZE
THE WORK OF AN IMPORTANT WORLD CONFERENCE; 2) AN HOUR
LONG SERIES OF BITTER PRRC-USSR EXCHANGES CONCERNING
WORLD WIDE AGGRESSION, ARMS BUILD-UPS, GROWING
THREATS OF A THIRD WORLD WAR, WHO IS THE REAL FRIEND
OF THE THIRD WORLD, REJECTIONS OF ONE ANOTHERS SLANDEROUS
STATEMENTS, ETC.; AND 3) AN EXTREMELY ADROIT, IMPARTIAL
PRESIDING JOB BY COUNCIL PRESIDENT ALARCON WHICH WAS
LARGELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COUNCIL ADJOURNING ON
SCHEDULE AMID A FLURRY OF EFFUSIVE PRAISE FOR
SESSIONAL OFFICERS, THE SECRETARIAT AND UNDP
ADMINISTRATOR MORSE.  END SUMMARY
2.  FINAL SESSION OF 22ND GOVERNING COUNCIL JULY 5
FIRST TOOK UP THE 20 PAGE REPORT (DP/L 311 REV 1)
OF TCDC COMMITTED WHICH WITH NUMEROUS NON-SUBSTATIVES
CHANGES WWAS APPROVED WITHOUT DEBATE.
3.  FOLLOWING APPROVAL OF THE TCDC REPORT AN ISRAELI OBSSERVER
(WHO WAS MAKING HIS FIRST APPEARANCE IN PLENARY, HAD
ATTENDED NONE OF THE FIVE TCDC COMMITTEE MEETINGS
AND WHO WHEN HE HAD INTROUDUCED HIMSELF TO THE US DEL
MINUTES BEFORE-TO FIND OUT THE STATUS OF THE HAVANA
UNDP GC VENUE ISSUE-HAD NOT INDICATED HE PLANNED TO
SPEAK) RECORDED IN A STRAIGHT-FORWARD MANNER GOOI
OPPOSITION TO EXPECTED PARTICIPATION BY THE PALESTINE
LIBERATION ORGANIZATION (PLO) IN THE WORLD CONFERENCE
ON TECHNICAL COOPERAION AMONG DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
SCHEDULED FOR BUENOS AIRES IN AUGUST 1977.  REBUTTAL
STATEMENTS WERE MADE BY KUWAIT
WHICH RECALLED GA RESOLUTIONS AND
ACCUSED ISRAEL OF SEEKING TO DESTROY PLO AND THE NATIONAL
IDENTITY OF PALESTINIAN PEOPLE; BY PRC WHICH EXPRESSED
"INDIGNATION" AT ATTACK ON PLO; AND BY USSR WHICH DEFENDED
PLO AS A TRUE LIBERATION MOVEMENT WITH THE RIIGHT TO
PURSUE ITS "STRUGGLE" IN ALL UN BODIES.  CURIOUSLY,
NO SPEAKER REFERRED TO AUDACIOUS ISRAELI RESCUE OF
HIJACKING HOSTAGES IN UGANDA REPORTED EXTENSIVELY
IN MORNIING PRESS.  IT SHOULD ALSO BE NOTED THAT PRIOR
TO THE ISRAELI INTERVENTION THERE HAD BEEN NO MENTION IN
ANY OF THE FIVE TCDC COMMITTEE MEETINGS OF THE PLO
EITHER IN CONNECTION WITH ITS POSSIBLE PARTICIPATION
AT THE WORLD CONFERENCE (SEE PARRA 15 OF DP/202 OF
7 MAY) OR OTHERWISE.
4.  DESPITE COUNCIL PRESIDENT ALARCON'S REQUEST THAT
ALL MEMBERS REFRAIN FROM REOPENING EARLIER DEBATES
DURING CONSIDERATION OF REPORT, USSR AND PRC FOR
THE THIRD SUCCESSIVE FINAL MEETING OF A UNDP GOVERNING
COUNCIL ENGAGED IN THEIR NOW FAMILIAR BOUT OF POLEMICS.
WITH INJURED INNOCENCE, USSR ACCUSED PRC OF
SLANDER AND A CONTINUING FAILURE TO MAKE ANY CONSTRUCTIVE
CONTRIBUTION TO EITHER THE UNDP COUNCIL OR THE UN IN
GENERAL.  PRC WITH RISING INVECTIVE PURSUDE ITS ATTACK
AT LENGTH SIX INTERVENTIONS UNTIL ALARCON WARNED THE COUNCIL OF THE
FINANCIAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE CONSEQUENCES IF SESSION
SPILLED OVER UNTIL JULY 6.  FOLLOWING A BRIEF
ADJOURNMENT AND AIDED BY RAPPORTEUR GHOSE (INDIA),
A COMPROMISE WAS REACHED (SIMILAR TO THE COMPROMISE
REACHED AT THE 21ST SESSION) WHICH PROVIDED FOR ONE
SHORT, FAIRLY BLAND, PARAGRAPH SUMMARIZING THE VIEWS OF
EACH SIDE BEING INCLUDED IN THE REPORT ( THE CHINESE
SUCCESSFULLY INSISTED THE RUSSIANS DROP THE PHRASE
"AND THE STRENGTHENING OF DETENTE" FROM ITS PARAGRAPH)
AND A FOOTNOTE IN THE REPORT THAT STATES "FOR  FURTHER DETAILS
SEE UNDP GC SUMMARY RECORDS 522,527 AND 543."
5.  SESSION ENDED ON UPBEAT AND EVEN SENTIMENTAL
NOTE WITH GUSH OF PRAISE FOR ALARCON, FIRST VICE
PRESIDENT AMB. HEDEMANN (NORWAY), SECOND VICE
PRESIDENT AMB. SALIFOU (NIGER) THIRD VICE PRESIDENT
CZARKOWSKI (POLAND), RAPPORTEUR GHOSE (INDIA) AND ADMINISTRATOR
MORSE.  SINCERE EXPRESSIONS OF FAREWELL OFFERED TO
MISS GHOSE WHO LIKE HEDEMANN AND SALIFOU BECAUSE OF
TRANSERES WOULD BE TERMINATING THEIR ASSOCIATION WITH
UNDP GC SESSIONS.
6.  CHIEFLY VIA THE MECHANISM OF CONSULTATIONS WITH
THE RAPPORTEUR HELD JUST BEFORE THE FINAL MEETING
COMMENCED, THE US DELEGATION WAS ABLE SUCCESSFULLY
AND WITHOUT CONTROVERY TO GET APPROXIMATELY TEN
SMALL "BALANCING" AMENDMENTS INCORPORATED INTO THE
FINAL REPORT OF THE SESSION.DALE

 * 82334 1976HONGK07882 0.007100737 | 1976-07-07 | HONG KONG | STATE | HONG KONG COMMUNIST PRESS DENOUNCES ISRAELI RESCUE OF HOSTAGES IN  UGANDA
OF HOSTAGES IN UGANDA
1. ALTHOUGH NCNA HAS CARRIED TWO NEWS ITEMS ON THE ATTEMPTED
COUP IN THE SUDAN, PRC DOMESTIC MEDIA ORGANS HAVE YET TO MENTION
THE ISRAELI RESCUE OF HOSTAGES HELD BY PALESTINIAN HIJACKERS
IN UGANDA. PRC-OWNED NEWSPAPER IN HONG KONG, HOWEVER, HAVE DE-
VOTED CONSIDERABLE SPACE TO FOREIGN WIRE SERVICE REPORTS OF
EVENTS IN UGANDA AS WELL AS THE UGANDAN AND AFRICAN REACTIONS
TO THE ISRAELI RESCUE OF THE HOSTAGES.
2. A JULY 6 COMMENTARY IN THE PRC-OWNED WEN WEI PAO HAS SHARPLY
DENOUNCED THE ISRAELI ACTION AS AN "ACT OF AGGRESSION". IT
NOTES THAT THE ISRAELI ACTION RESULTED IN THE DEATH OF UGANDAN
SOLIDERS AND DESTRUCTION OF MORE THAN TEN PLANES AT THE AIRFIELD
AND ASSERTS THAT SUCH ACTION WILL CERTAINLY GIVE RISE TO
WIDESPREAD CRITICISM.
3. THE COMMENTARY MAINTAINS THAT THE WORLD'S REVOLUTIONARY
PEOPLES SUPPORT RESTORATION OF THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE'S
RIGHTS TO THEIR HOMELAND, BUT IT CAREFULLY REFRAINS FROM CONDON-
ING THE HIJACKING, POINTEDLY NOTING THAT PEOPLE DO NOT CONSIDER
THIS TYPE OF "STRUGGLE" WORTHY OF SUPPORT. AT THE SAME TIME,
IT REJECTS ISRAELI CONTENTIONS THAT UNGANDAN AUTHORITIES WERE
ASSISTING THE HIJACKING AND NOTES UGANDAN ASSERTIONS OF CONCERN
FOR THE SAFETY OF THE HOSTAGES. MAINTAININGTHATEACH COUNTRY
HAS THE RIGHT TO HANDLE HIJACKERS IN ITS OWN WAY, THE COMMENTRAY
DENOUNCES THE ISREALI ASSERTION THAT THE ACTION WAS ONE OF
"REASONABLE AGGRESSION" AS "PIRATE'S LOGIC". IF SUCH LOGIC
WERE ACCEPTED, THE COMMENTARY ADDS, THEN ANY COUNTRY INVOLVED
IN HIJACKING COULD BE SUBJECT TO A MILITARY ATTACK.
4. THE COMMENTARY CONCLUDES BY RAISING THE SPECTRE OF THE
SUPERPOWERS. THAT SUCH A SMALL COUNTRY AS ISRARL WAS EMBOLDENED
TO UNDERTAKE SUCH AN ACTION THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY FROM HOME IS
ATTRIBUTED TO (1) US SUPPORT FOR ISREAL AND (2) INCREASING
YET SECRET ASSISTANCE RENDERED BY THE SOVIETS.

 * 252132 1976STATE166467 0.007100678 | 1976-07-03 | STATE | SECRETARY | TALK WITH JUMBLATT JULY 1
SUMMARY: JUMBLATT SPOKE FOR ALMOST 2 HOURS WITH ME ON WIDE
RANGE OF SUBJECTS. HE OUTLINED THE "SINS" OF THE CHRISTIANS AND
THE NEED TO REALIZE HOW MUCH THEY HAD TO LOSE IN SPECIFIC TERMS
FROM THEIR CURRENT ALLIANCE WITH THE SYRIANS.  HE ATTACKED
SYRIAN POLICY AND THOUGHT THE FIRST STEP IS THAT SYRIANS GET OUT
BEFORE A ROUND TABLE DISCUSSION CAN PROCEED.  HE WAS
GENERALLY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT CHANCES OF ENDING THE FIGHTING IN THE
NEAR FUTURE (THOUGH GIVING NO SPECIFIC EVIDENCE OF THIS BEYOND
THE GENERAL FEELING THAT "PEOPLE NEED A REST"), AND SAID TIME HAD
COME FOR COMPROMISE. HOWEVER, ROUND TABLE DISCUSSIONS MUST
BE CAREFULLY PREPARED, AND GAVE AS AN EXAMPLE TALKS HE AND THE
PALESTINIANS HAVE HAD WITH BASHIR GEMAYEL, SON OF PIERRE
GEMAYEL. HE OUTLINED SOME REFORMS, INCLUDING PROPORTIONAL
REPRESENTATION AND DE-CONFESSIONALIZATION OF THE STATE, AS
EXAMPLES OVER WHICH COMPROMISE CAN BE REACHED. THOUGH
RESTED AND SPEAKING IN REASONABLE TERMS, HE WAS NOT VERY
CONVINCING THAT PEACE IS AROUND THE CORNER.  END SUMMARY.
1.  I TOOK LAMBRADIS WITH ME TO CALL ON JUMBLATT JULY 1.  HE
LOOKED RESTED AFTER SOMETIME IN HIS MOUNTAIN RETREAT, WHERE
HE WAS NOT VERY INVOLVED WITH CURRENT POLITICS OVER THE PAST
WEEK OR SO.  HE WAS WELL-DRESSED, HAD A NEAT HAIRCUT, AND
GENERALLY PRESENTED A VERY RELAXED IMAGE AS HE OFFERED US
FRUIT AND DEVOURED IT HIMSELF, AS IS HIS AFTERNOON HABIT.
2.  NOTING THAT HE HAD NEVER MET AMBASSADOR MELOY
PERSONALLY, HE BEGAN WITH EXPRESSIONS OF PERSONAL SORROW AT
THE DEATH OF ROBERT WARING.  HE HAD CONSIDERED HIM AN
HONEST FRIEND AND HAD NOTED THINGS HE HAD DISCUSSED WITH
WARING WERE LISTENED TO IN WASHINGTON, SINCE HE HAD SEEN
PLAYBACKS OF THEM A FEW DAYS LATER IN PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS
OR PRESS REPORTS.  WHEN ASKED FOR HIS CURRENT BEST
ESTIMATE OF WHO THE MURDERERS WERE, JUMBLATT SAID HE
THOUGHT THE MURDERS HAD BEEN ORDERED BY DR. HADDAD, WHO
IS GEORGE HABASH'S DEPUTY IN THE PFLP.  HE SAID HE HAD
NOT BEEN IN TOUCH MORE RECENTLY WITH SPECIFICS OF THE
INVESTIGATION, BUT WOULD LOOK INTO IT FOR US.  I PRESSED HIM
ON THIS SCORE, AND HE SEEMED COMPLETELY WILLING TO DO WHAT
HE COULD.  HE NOTED HIS OWN SISTER'S DEATH AND THE WOUNDING
OF HIS NIECES.  SUCH PERSONAL GRIEF HELPS ONE APPRECIATE
THE GRIEF OF OTHERS, HE SAID.
3.  I EXPLAINED MY MISSION TO THE LEBANON, AND NOTED THAT IN
EARLIER CONVERSATIONS SINCE MY ARRIVAL CERTAIN SUGGESTIONS HAD
COME UP ON WHICH I HAD CONSISTENTLY TRIED TO SET THE RECORD
STRAIGHT.  I HAVE BEEN POINTING OUT THAT THE US IS AGAINST
LEBANESE PARTITION.  I HAVE MADE A POINT OF MENTIONING UNITY
OF LEBANON IN MY PUBLIC UTTERANCES.  I ALSO HAVE TRIED TO DEBUNK
LIES SUGGESTING THERE IS A SYRIAN-ISRAELI-CHRISTIAN-USG
CONSPIRACY TO SUPPRESS THE PALESTINIAN AND THE LEFT IN LEBANON.
I NOTED THAT THE PRESS AND RADIO NEVERTHELESS CONTINUED TO INSIST
ON THIS THEME DESPITE ANYTHING THE USG OR I CAN SAY.  JUMBLATT
NODDED HIS UNDERSTANDING.
4.  JUMBLATT ADVERTED INDIRECTLY TO US-SYRIAN COLLUSION.  HE
SAID HE BELIEVED US WHEN WE SAY WE ARE AGAINST PARTITION.
HOWEVER, US USED TO BE VERY STRICT ON QUESTION OF THE
INDEPENDENCE OF LEBANON.  THIS CAME UP IN 1958 EVEN IN
CONNECTION WITH US FACILITATING THE ELECTION OF GENERAL CHEHAB.
ISRAEL HAD BEEN WELL AWARE OVER THE YEARS OF US SUPPORT FOR
LEBANESE INDEPENDENCE.  HOWEVER, THERE HAVE BEEN SOME
CURIOUS EVENTS RECENTLY IN SYRIA.  ASSAD HAS "TURNED COSSACK"
AGAINST THE SOVIETS.  HE HAS RENEWED UNDOF MANDATE ON
GOLAN HEIGHTS WITHOUT ANY FUSS.  ONE CANNOT ESCAPE THE
CONCLUSION THAT US PERMISSION HAS BEEN GIVEN TO SYRIANS TOH
TO VERY FAR INDEED.  EVERYONE BELIEVES THIS, AND JUMBLATT
HAD TOLD THIS TO AMBASSADOR BROWNN WHO HE SAID OF COURSE
DENIED IT.  ONE CANNOT IMAGINE THE SYRIANS WOULD DARE ALLOW
THEIR TROOPS TO ENTER LEBANON WITHOUT SOME KIND OF US
GO-AHEAD. THIS IS A "PLOT" OF WHICH EDDE HAS BEEN TALKING
FOR A YEAR AND A HALF.
6.  JUMBLATT SAID HE BELIEVED SECRETARY KISSINGER HAS A
METHOD WHICH JUMBALTT ADMIRES IN ITS TACTICAL EFFICACY.  IT LETS
PEOPLE FIGHT EACH OTHER UNTIL THEY ARE TIRED AND THEN KISSINGER
STEPS IN WITH A SOLUTION.  BUT US SHOULD BE CAREFUL NOT TO LOSE
ITS FRIENDS IN THE LEBANON.  A SOCIALIST STATE MIGHT RISE IN THE
LEBANON OVER THE NEXT 2 TO 4 YEARS. (IN REPLY TO MY QUESTION,
JUMBLATT INSISTED HE WAS SPEAKING ABOUT A SOCIALIST STATE, NOT
A COMMUNIST.)
7.  SOCIAL REFORM HAD BECOME NECESSARY TO COUNTER MARONITE
PRIVILEGE, WHICH IS EXERCISED IN TERMS REMINISCENT OF THE
MIDDLE AGES.  FIVE PROPRIETORS OWN MOST OF THE BEKAA.  THERE
ARE UNCULTIVATED LANDS GOING TO WASTE WHILE HUNDREDS AND
THOUSANDS ARE MISERABLE IN THEIR POVERTY.  THE COUNTRY NEEDS
TRUE DEMOCRACY.  PROGRESSIVE FORCES WHICH JUMBLATT LEADS
BELIEVE IN LIBERTY.  THEY DO NOT BELIEVE IN COMMUNISM, NOR
CLASS WARFARE, OR IN COUPS D'ETAT.  HE CLAIMED ALONG THAT
LINE TO HAVE PREVENTED GENERAL AHDAB FROM MARCHING AGAINST
FRANGIE WHEN FRANGIE DID NOT RESIGN IN MARCH.  THIS WAS NOT
THE DEMOCRATIC WAY, JUMBLATT SAID.  (AS WE RECALL IT,
JUMBLATT'S GROUP MAY HAVE HAD A PART IN THIS, BUT IT IS FAR
FROM CLEAR THAT HE ALONE PREVENTED AHDAB FROM MARCHING.)
8.  THE MARONITES MUST UNDERSTAND THAT OPPOSITION TO THEM CAN
CONTINUE FOR YEARS IF THEY DO NOT YIELD.  JUMBLATT IS PREPARED
TO DISCUSS THINGS OVER THE ROUND TABLE, BUT NOT TO CONTINUE
ACCEPTING MARONITE MASTERY OF THE COUNTRY.  MARONITES HAVE
SEVERAL SPECIFIC THINGS THEY SHOULD THINK ABOUT: FIRST, IT IS
NOT CLEAR HOW FAR COMMUNISTS MIGHT GO IN LEBANON.
JUMBLATT SAID HE DID NOT LIKE THE COMMUNISTS HIMSELF (AND IN
FACT EXPECTS GREATER DEMOCRATIZATION IN THE SOVIET UNION BY
ABOUT 1985).  HOWEVER, MARONITES SHOULD FEAR COMMUNIST
TREND IN LEBANON IF CONDITIONS ON WHICH THEY BREED ARE NOT
CHANGED.  SECOND, MARONITES SHOULD FEAR EMIGRATION OF THEIR
OWN PEOPLE IF THEY MAINTAIN CURRENT SEPARATENESS BEHIND
THEIR GUNS.  JUMBLATT WAS TOLD 80 PERCENT OF DOCTORS HAVE
ALREADY FLED THE COUNTRY.  THESE STUBBORN
MARONITES MAY SOME DAY FIND THEIR NUMBERS
SO REDUCED THAT THEY WILL BE FACED BY A CRUSHING
MAJORITY OF ISLAM.  THIRD, MARONITES SHOULD FEAR SYRIA.
SOME SUCH AS BASHIR GEMAYEL WISELY OPPOSED SYRIAN
INTERVENTION FOR THIS REASON; OTHERS -- PARTICULARLY THE
MONKS AND CLERICS OF THE CATHOLIC FRONT -- MAINTAIN THEIR
HOPES FOR A NEW CRUSADE.  SYRIANS BELIEVE THEY HAVE A CHANCE
TO REPLACE MOTHER FRANCE AS PROTECTOR OF LEBANON, AND IN
PARTICULAR THE MARONITES.  BUT ONE DAY THERE COULD BE A CHANGE
OF REGIME IN SYRIA WITH SUNNIS OVERTHROWING THE REGIME AND
LIVING UP THEIR FORCES IN LEBANON WITH THE LEFT.  TOP
CHRISTIAN LEADERS SHOULD REALIZE THIS.  (COMMENTING
SPECIFICALLY ON GEMAYEL, JUMBLATT SAID HE SUFFERED FROM
HALLUCINATIONS AND HAD NO INTELLECTUAL BAGGAGE.  CLINICALLY HIS
FATHER HAD SUFFERED FROM HALLUCINATIONS.)
9.  FINALLY, CHRISTIANS SHOULD REALIZE FORTUNE THEY MADE IN
THE PAST WAS BASED ON EXPLOITATION OF ARAB OIL AND SERVICES TO
OTHER ARAB COUNTRIES.  MARONITES HAVE LOST MUCH OF THIS
MONEY (HE SPOKE OF 50,000 LEBANESE IN FRANCE, MANY OF
THEM IN FINANCIAL NEED AT PRESENT).  MARONITES MUST REALIZE
THAT THESE ARAB STATES WILL TURN AGAINST EHEM AND ISOLATE
THEM IF THEY CONTINUE TO BEHAVE AS THEY DO.  JUMBLATT
HIMSELF HAD TO INTERVENE SOME MONTHS AGO FOR FRIENDS WHO WERE
ABOUT TO BE EXPELLED FROM LIBYA AND KUWAIT.
10.  TROUBLE WITH MARONITES, JUMBLATT SUMMED UP, IS THAT THEY
ARE OBSESSED BY FEAR.  SARKIS MAY TURN OUT TO BE THE LAST
MARONITE PRESIDENT OF LEBANON.  THEY MADE A BIG MISTAKE IN
CURRENT ATTACK ON TELL ZAATAR, WHICH HE WAS SORRY TO SEE
BASHIR GEMAYEL ALSO JOINED IN ON FINALLY.  MUSLIMS COULD HAVE
DONE NASTY THINGS TO CHRISTIAN VILLAGES SUCH AS DEIR EL-QAMAR
(IN THE CHOUF), BUT THEY WOULD NOT.  NOR WOULD MUSLIMS ATTACK
CHRISTIANS IN RAS BEIRUT, AS MANY SEEMED TO FEAR.  MARONITES
MUST HAVE CONFIDENCE IN DEMOCRACY AND ACCEPT WESTERNIZING
THE COUNTRY INSTITUTIONS.  BY THIS HE MEANT REFORMS TO SUPPRESS
SECTARIANISM AND ESTABLISH GOVERNMENT ON MODERN PRINCIPLES.
11.  I ASKED HIM IF HE HAD NOT ACCEPTED THE COMPROMISE AGREEMENT
ANNOUNCED LAST FEBRUARY BY FRANGIE.  JUMBLATT SAID THOSE POINTS
HAD BEEN ACCEPTABLE THEN, BUT CHRISTIANS HAD REJECTED THEM, AND
SITUATION HAS CHANGED.  THE LEFT ALLIANCES PARTIES WILL NO LONGER
ACCEPT THEM.  IN THIS SENSE MARONITES ARE ARABS, AND HAVE BEEN
ACTING AS ARABS HAVE ACTED HISTORICALLY TOWARDS ISRAEL --
THEY ACCEPT NOTHING UNTIL IT IS TOO LATE.
12.  COURSE AHEAD, JUMBLATT SAID, MUST BE TO PREPARE A
COMPROMISE AGREEMENT.  THIS MUST BE PRECEDED BY NEGOTIATIONS
THROUGH QUIET OR PUBLIC CONTACTS BETWEEN THE SIDES, BEFORE FINAL
AGREEMENT IS BROUGHT TO A ROUND TABLE AND SANCTIONED THERE.
THEN THERE SHOULD BE A NEW PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION ACCORDING
TO THE NEW PRINCIPLES AGREED UPON.  WHEN ASKED TO SPECIFY
REFORMS HE WANTED, HE MENTIONED PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION
IN PARLIAMENT WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF GETTING MORE YOUNG PEOPLE
IN.  HOWEVER, THIS SHOULD BE LIMITED TO NO MORE THAN THREE
PARTIES BEING ELECTED, AND LIST SHOULD PERMIT VOTERS TO EXPRESS
INDIVIDUAL PREFERENCES FOR PEOPLE ON THE LIST.  A SECOND CHAMBER
SHOULD BE CREATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS WELL-PUBLICIZED
PROGRAM.  OBJECTIVE IS TO ABOLISH CONFESSIONALISM AND
ELEIMINATE MEDIOCRITY IN PARLIAMENT.  I ASKED IF HE MEANT
ELIMINATING FEUDAL REMNANTS.  NO, JUMBLATT INSISTED, HE MEANT
ELIMINATING MEDIOCRITY. (COMMENT: JUMBLATT OF COURSE
DERIVES HIS MOST STEADY SUPPORT FROM HIS TRADITIONAL FEUDAL
SUZERAINTY OVER MUCH OF THE DRUZE COMMUNITY).
13.  PHALANGE (PROBABLY BASHIR GEMAYEL) HAS ACCEPTED
PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION, JUMBLATT ASSERTED, BUT NOT
AN END TO CONFESSIONALISM.  JUMBLATT THOUGH PARTIES OF THE
LEFT CAN IMPOSE ON OTHER, MORE CONSERVATIVE MUSLIMS A REFORM
PROGRAM WHICH WOULD, FOR EXAMPLE, PERMIT CIVIL MARRIAGE AND
SIMILAR CHANGES WHICH MANY CHRISTIANS SUPPORT.  YOUNG
PEOPLE, BOTH CHRISTIAN AND MUSLIM, ARE IDEALISTIC.  THEY WILL
INSIST ON TOUGH REFORMS.  THERE IS LITTLE DIFFERNENCE BETWEEN
THESE YOUNG PEOPLE, EXCEPT THAT THE CHRISTIAN YOUTH DO NOT
UNDERSTAND THE PALESTINIANS AND HOW TO HANDLE THEM.
MEANWHILE, COMPETITION AMONG TRADITIONAL CHRISTIAN LEADDERS
SUCH AS CHAMOUN AND GEMAYEL LENDS TO ESCALATION OF RHETORIC
AND MILITARY ACTION FOR NO GOOD REASON.  THIS SHOULD END.
14.  AS TO PALESTINIANS, ELIMINATION OF SAIQA HAS BEEN A GOOD
THING.  OF COURSE SOME GROUPS SUCH AS PFLP RESORT
INOPPORTUNELY TO TERRORISM (HERE JUMBLATT SHOWED HE DID
NOT APPROVE RECENT AIR FRANCE HIJACKING).  THERE ARE ALSO
TROUBLE-MAKING SMALL GROUPS BACKED BY LIBYANS AND IRAQIS
AS WELL AS SYRIANS.  HOWEVER, WITH SAIQA DISAPPEARANCE,
PALESTINIANS CAN NOW IMPOSE THEIR OWN LAW AMONG MOST OF
THEIR PEOPLE.  LEBANESE MUST LEARN HOW TO DEAL WITH
PALESTINIANS, OFFER THEM A BETTER LIFE.  THIS IS AN IMPORTANT
PEOPLE NUMBERING THREE MILLION THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.  THEY DO
NOT WANT TO LIVE HERE ONLY AS AN ARMY.  IN THIS SENSE, JUMBLATT
SAID HE HAD NO FEAR FOR THE FUTURE OF THE COUNTRY.  PEOPLE MAY
EVEN HAVE BENEFITED FROM THEIR EXORCISM OF BLOOD....
15.  SPECIFICALLY, JUMBLATT SAID, 1969 DAIRO ACCORD IS OUT OF
DATE,  BUT MODUS VIVENDI CAN BE REACHED WITH PALESTINIANS.  HE
NOTED THAT PALESTINIANS REMAIN IN TOUCH WITH CHRISTIANS THROUGH
ABU HASSAN WHO GOES BACK AND FORTH ACROSS THE DIVIDING LINE,
AS DOES PHALANGE'S BAYIR GEMAYEL.  HE THEN MADE SOME
REMARKS ABOUT A VIABLE PALESTINIAN STATE TO INCLUDE JORDAN,
AND THE 1,200,000 PALESTINIANS HAVING A COANCE TO RETURN TO
THEIR HOMES IN HAIFA, ETC. ETC. (JUMBLATT IS CLEARLY BEYOND
HIS DEPTH OR INTEREST WHEN HE STARTS TALKING ABOUT THE LARGER
PALESTINIAN PROBLEM).
16.  SPECIFICALLY ON SYRIANS, JUMBLATT SAID THAT THEY MUST LEAVE
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  ALL MUSLIMS ARE AGAINST THEM.  ASSAD IS
A MEDIOCRE MAN WHO HAS REPEATEDLY REFUSED TO TAKE
OPPORTUNITIES TO GET OUT OF THE LEBANON.  AS TO REASONS FOR
SYRIAN INTERVENTION, JUMBLATT SPECULATED, SOME SAY SYRIA
WANTS THE BEKAA.  OTHERS SAY SYRIA WISHES TO REPLACE FRANCE
AND HAS TAKEN THIS HISTORIC OPPORTUNITY TO GET CLOSE TO THE
MARONITES.  JUMBLATT CLAIMED ASSAD HAS SPECIFICALLY
TOLD HIM THIS ON FREQUENT OCCASIONS WHILE THEY WERE STILL IN
CONTACT, AS OF A FEW MONTHS AGO.  ALSO, ASSAD HOPED TO WIN
A CARD IN HIS DIPLOMATIC GAME, GOING TO FRANCE AS A FRIEND OF
JORDAN ON THE ONE HAND AND WITH CONTROL OVER LEBANON AND THE
PALESTINIANS ON THE OTHER.  THIS WOULD HAVE HELPED HIM IN US
EYES TOO AND MAYBE HELPED GET A GOLAN SETTLEMENT OF THE KIND
HE WANTS.  HOWEVER, EGYPT IS NOW BEGINNING TO REPLACE
SYRIA IN THE LEBANON AS IS NORMAL.  AT LEAST SADAT IN HIS
SINAI II POLICY WAS FRANK.  HE HAS WON MUCH RESPECT.
17.  JUMBLATT TENDED TO DOWN-PLAY THE PROBLEM OF SECURITY
IN LEBANON.  HE SAID THE VARIOUS PARTIES ARE BEGINNING TO TAKE
SECURITY IN HAND.  THERE ARE FEWER ASSASSINATIONS NOW AND LOOTING
IS LESS BOTH IN BEIRUT AND IN THE MOUNTAINS.  THE LEBANESE
ARMY WILL BE REBUILT.  THE POPULACE, ONCE IT HAS PEACE, WILL
SELL ITS ARMS.  WITH $20 MILLION, JUMBLATT SAID, THE STATE
COULD BUY BACK THE ARMS ITSELF.  PEOPLE ARE HUNGRY.  AGAIN
HE RETURNED TO HIS THEME THAT YOUNG PEOPLE MUST BE ALLOWED
TO TAKE POWER IN THIS COUNTRY.
18.  FINALLY, JUMBLATT WISHED ME WELL.  HE SAID DEAN BROWN
DID A GOOD JOB HERE.  HE PERHAPS LACKED PATIENCE.  IT IS
BETTER TOWORK A LITTLE MORE SLOWLY AND PATIENTLY AND PERHAPS
WITH LOWER PROFILE, BUT US CAN BE HELPFUL.
19.  SUMMING UP HIS VIEWS, JUMBLATT SAID HE EXPECTED THE
WAR TO END SOON.  EVEN THOUGH HE ADMITTED HIS OWN AIMS ARE
WHAT AMOUNT TO A CONTINUOUS REVOLUTION UNTIL POWER MOVES
FROM THE HANDS OF THE MARONITES TO HIS OWN AND THOSE OF
OTHERS ALLIED WITH HIM, HE THOUGHT MEDITERRANEAN PEOPLE
SUCH AS THE LEBANESE AND PALESTINIANS NEED A REST.  TIME
HAS COME FOR COMPROMISE, AND HE IS PREPARED FOR THAT.
WHEN I ASKED WHETHER CONCENTRATED BITTERNESS BETWEEN
FACTIONS MIGHT NOT IMPEDE COMPROMISE, HE SAID PEOPLE
TEND TO FORGET THE CARNAGE, BLOOD, AND DESTRUCTION,
PARTICULARLY IF A CATASTROPHE IS BIG ENOUGHT.  MEANWHILE
NOTHING CAN BE DONE BY WAY OF FORMAL PEACEMAKING UNTIL
THE SYRIANS WITHDRAW TOTALLY FROM THE LEBANON.
20.  COMMENT:  AS I HAVE BEEN TOLD TO EXPECT, JUMBLATT
HAS AN UNCANNILY WINNING PERSONALITY.  IT IS HARD TO DISLIKE THE
MAN FACE TO FACE.  HE HAS MANY MOODS AND MANY GUISES AND
SEEMS TO BE SPEAKING FRANKLY AT ALL TIMES.  HOWEVER, WHAT HE
SAID OFTEN STRUCK ME AS UNREALISTIC TO SAY THE LEAST.  IN
PARTICULAR, I WAS STRUCK BY HIS GREAT OPTIMISM TO ME IN VIEW
OF HIS SIMULTANEOUS PUBLIC PRONOUNCEMENTS THAT THE WAR WILL
CONTINUE AND VIETNAMIZATION MAY RESULT IF THE CHRISTIANS DO NOT
STOP THEIR ATTACK ON TELL XAATAR.  HE IS CLEARLY A MAN WHOSE
WORDS SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN AT FACE VALUE.  BUT HE IS ALSO A
LEADER WHO SEEMS INDISPENSIBLE IN THE CURRENT POLITICAL
MAKEUP HERE.  HE IS OUT TO BECOME NUMBER ONE IN THE LEBANON,
EVEN IF THIS TAKES A FEW MORE YEARS.

1.  DISCUSSED SUBJECT REFTEL WITH ST. LEGIER, FOREIGN
MINISTRY DIRECTOR FOR UNITED NATIONS AFFAIRS.
2.  ST. LEGIER SAID IT WAS HIS UNDERSTANDING THAT AMIN
HAD FILED COMPLAINT WITH SECURITY COUNCIL, BUT HAD NOT
REQUESTED A MEETING.  GOF HOPES THIS IS TRUE.
2.  IN THE EVENT AN SC MEETING TAKES PLACE, ST. LEGIER
SAID GOF AGREES THAT ANY RESOLUTION MUST NOT BE UNBAL-
ANCED.  UGANDA MUST BE CRITICIZED FOR AIDING THE TERROR-
ISTS.  THE QUESTION OF ISRAEL'S ACTION IS CAUSING GOF
JURIDICAL PROBLEMS.  WHEREAS UGANDA'S AID TO TERRORISTS
IS CLEARLY IN VIOLATION OF INTERNATIONAL CONVENTIONS,
SPECIFICALLY THE 1972 ANTI-HIJACKING TREATY, IT IS DIF-
FICULT TO FIND A PRECEDENT IN INTERNATIONAL LAW TO JUS-
TIFY ISRAEL'S VIOLATION OF UGANDA'S SOVEREIGNTY.  GOF
LAWYERS ARE WORKING ON THIS ASPECT.
3.  BECAUSE OF THE UNCLEAR JURIDICAL ASPECTS, ST. LEGIER
SAID THE BEST COURSE MIGHT BE TO CALL FOR AN OFFICIAL
ENQUIRY IN ORDER TO BURY THE ISSUE.  ON THE BASIC ISSUES,
HOWEVER, THE GOF IS ON OUR SIDE--OPPOSITION TO AN UNBAL-
ANCED RESOLUTION, AND LANGUAGE IN THE RESOLUTION MUST
INCLUDE CRITICISM OF UGANDA'S ASSISTANCE TO THE TERROR-
ISTS.
4.  COMMENT:  ST. LEGIER'S REMARKS REVEAL GOF DILEMMA.
ISRAELI ACTION WAS TREMENDOUSLY POPULAR IN FRANCE.
FRENCH PRESS WAS ECSTATIC IN ITS PRAISE.  ON THE OTHER
HAND, FRANCE WANTS TO GET THE AIR BUS BACK FROM ENTEBBE
AIRPORT, AND DOES NOT WANT TO BE OPPOSED TO AFRICAN
OPINION RIGHT AFTER RECEIVING CRITICISM OF THE NUCLEAR
REACTOR SALE TO SOUTH AFRICA.  HENCE, A DESIRE FOR NO
MEETING, AND FOR NO RESOLUTION IF THERE IS A MEETING.

JAYAKODY, ISSUED STATEMENT JULY 6 WHICH CONDEMNED THE
ISRAELI RESCUE OF HOSTAGES AT ENTEBBE AIRPORT "AS AN ACT OF
AGGRESSION AND A GRAVE VIOLATION OF THE SOVEREIGNITY OF

HOWEVER,THAT SRI LANKA DID NOT CONDONE THE HIJACKING OF

2. TEXT OF STATEMENT IS: "WE DO NOT CONDONE THE HIJACKING

"AT THE SAME TIME WE WISH EXPRESS ONCE AGAIN OUR SUPPORT

3. COMMENT: STATEMENT APPEARS TO BE ATTEMPT TO PROMOTE
SRI LANKA'S IMAGE AMONG NON-ALINGED. WHILE IT ALSO REITERATES
SRI LANKA'S STRONG SUPPORT FOR PALESTINIAN
CAUSE, DISCLAIMER AT VERY START INDICATES CEYLONESE WANT
TO AVOID ANY IMPLICATION THAT THEY CONDONE OR SUPPORT
TERRIORISM. IN FACT, MANY CEYLONESE HAVE PRIVATELY EXPRESSED
CONSIDERABLE APPROBATION OF ISRAELI ACTION.

 * 309214 1976TELAV04606 0.007090061 | 1976-07-04 | TEL AVIV | STATE USUN NEW YORK | RABIN KNESSET STATEMENT ON ISRAELI ACTION IN UGANDA SUMMARY
SUMMARY
1.  PRIME MINISTER RABIN, AT SPECIAL KNESSET SESSION AT 3PM ON JULY
4, DELIVERED FIFTEEN MINUTE STATEMENT TO PACKED CHAMBER ON GOI
DECISIONS AND IDF ACTIVITY AT ENTEBBE AIRPORT ON NIGHT OF JULY 3-4.
HIS MAIN POINT WAS THAT ISRAELI GOVERNMENT BEARS EXCLUSIVE RESPON-
SIBILITY FOR THE RESCUE OPERATION.  ALL KNESSET PARTIES EXCEPT RAKAH
COMMUNISTS ADOPTED RESOLUTION PRAISING THE IDF ACTION.  FOLLOWING
ARE HIGHLIGHTS.  END SUMMARY.
2.  THE ISRAELI DEFENSE FORCES (IDF), RABIN SAID, HAD CARRIED OUT
WITH GREAT HEROISM THE GOVERNMENT'S DECISION TO RESCUE THE HOSTAGES
ON THE AIR FRANCE AIRCRAFT AT ENTEBBE AIRPORT.  THREE ISRAELIS, TWO
CIVILIAN HOSTAGES AND THE MILITARY COMMANDER, HAD BEEN KILLED.
(RABIN DID NOT SPECIFY UGANDAN OR TERRORIST CASUALTIES).  THIS WAS ON
E
OF THE FINEST OPERATIONS IN THE IDF'S HISTORY, AND ONE OF WHICH ALL
ISRAELIS COULD BE JUSTIFIABLY PROUD.
3.  THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT ALONE BEARS THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS
RESCUE OPERATION WHICH WAS NOT COORDINATED WITH ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT.
HOWEVER, ALL GOVERNMENTS MUST WORK TOGETHER IN THE CONTINUING
STRUGGLE AGAINST INTERNATIONAL AIR TERRORISM.
4.  RABIN REVIEWED DEVELOPMENT OF EVENTS SINCE START OF HIJACKING
INCIDENT, EMPHASIZING THE UNIQUE DIFFICULTIES CONFRONTING THE GOI
IN DEALING WITH SITUATION INVOLVING GOVERNMENT OF UGANDA WITH WHICH
ISRAEL DOES NOT HAVE DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS.  FROM THE OUTSET, THERE
WAS FULL POLITICAL COORDINATION WITH THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT FOR THE
RELEASE OF THE HOSTAGES.  IT BECAME CLEAR DURING THE WEEK THAT A) A
MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THE TERRORISTS WAS TO KEEP THE ISRAELI PASSENGERS
HOSTAGES AND B) IDI AMIN, THE HEAD OF THE UGANDAN GOVERNMENT, WAS
COOPERATING WITH THE TERRORISTS.
5.  ON JULY 1, THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT DECLARED ITS READINESS TO NE-
GOTIATE AN EXCHANGE OF PRISONERS FOR THE RELEASE OF THE HOSTAGES.
THIS WAS NOT A PHONY DEVICE TO BUY TIME.  THE GOI WAS PREPARED TO
IMPLEMENT ITS JULY 1 DECISION.
6.  SIMULTANEOUSLY, HOWEVER, THE IDF FORMULATED ITS PLANS FOR A RESCU
E
OPERATION.  IN THE LAST PHASE, THE GOI UNANIMOUSLY AUTHORIZED THE IDF
TO CARRY OUT THIS OPERATION.  THE GOVERNMENT MAINTAINED FULL CONSUL-
TATIONS AND BRIEFINGS WITH THE KNESSET FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND SECURITY
COMMITTEE THROUGHOUT THE VARIOUS STAGES OF DECISION-MAKING.
7.  THIS RESCUE OPERATION CONSTITUTES ISRAEL'S CONTRIBUTION TO THE
INTERNATIONAL FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM.  BUT THIS STRUGGLE IS FAR FROM
FINISHED AND IT WILL REQUIRE CONTINUING VIGILANCE AND ACTION.  IN
CLOSING, RABIN AGAIN NOTED THAT THE RESCUE OPERATION WAS ONE OF THE
GREATEST ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE IDF.
8.  LIKUD OPPOSITION LEADER, BEGIN SAID THAT ISRAEL HAD NOT HAD
NATIONAL UNITY AS GREAT AS IT ENJOYED TODAY SINCE ITS VICTORY IN THE
1967 WAR.  HE PAID THIBUTE TO THE IDF, AND EXPRESSED CONDOLENCES TO
THE ISRAELI VICTIMS.  CONGRATULATING RABIN FOR HIS LEADERSHIP, BEGIN
SAID THAT RESCUE OPERATION HAD FULL SUPPORT OF THE LIKUD, AND THAT IN
THIS MOMENT INTERNAL POLITICAL DIFFERENCES WERE TRANSCENDED BY SENSE
OF NATIONAL UNITY.  BEGIN URGED FORMATION OF SPECIAL COMMANDO UNIT TO
COMBAT TERRORISM.  HE COMPARED TERRORISTS TO NAZIS, AND MADE SHARP
ATTACK ON SOVIETS FOR SUPPLYING UGANDA'S RACIST DICTATOR WITH MIGS
AND OTHER EQUIPMENT.  HE WARNED ARABS THAT ISRAEL WILL NOT BE PASSIVE
IN CONFRONTING ITS ENEMIES, ALTHOUGH IT SEEKS TO LIVE IN PEACE WITH
ITS NEIGHBORS.
9.  AT CLOSE OF 45 MINUTE SESSION, ALL PARTIES EXCEPT RAKAH COMMU-
NISTS ADOPTED RESOLUTION EXPRESSING APPRECIATION TO IDF, CONDOLENCES
TO ISRAELI DEAD, AND QUICK RECOVERY FOR THE WOUNDED.
10.  COMMENT:  CABINET AND KNESSET MEMBERS WERE OBVIOUSLY RELIEVED
AT END OF WEEK LONG ORDEAL AND NEAR-JUBILANT OVER ITS OUTCOME.
SUCCESSFUL RESCUE OPERATION HAS GIVEN STRONG BOOST TO PUBLIC MORALE
AND CERTAINLY STRENTHENED RABIN GOVERNMENT'S DOMESTIC POSITION.  IN
CONVERSATION WITH EMBOFF, KNESSET MEMBERS EXPRESSED APPRECIATION FOR
PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE WHICH HAD ALREADY RECEIVED WIDE DISSEMINATION.

1. PRIVATE REACTION OF NEPALESE LEADERSHIP TO RECENT
ISRAELI RAID AGAINST ENTEBBE AIRPORT IS NEARLY UNIVERSAL
IN ITS ACCLAIM. FOREING MINISTRY OFFICIALS EXPRESSED RELIEF
AND GRATITUDE FOR ISRAEILI DECISION, ALTHOUGH THEY ALSO
OFFERED VIEW THAT "TERRORISTS WILL BE OBLIGED TO RETALIATE".
ONE RUSSIAN DIPLOMAT AT JULY 4TH RECEPTION WAS OBSERVED
TO REMARK QUIETLY TO ISRAELI AMBASSADOR THAT "ALTHOUGH I
CAN'T SAY SO PUBLICLY, MY HEARTIEST CONGRATUALTIONS."
TWO PROMINENT LEFTIS NEPALESE POLITICIANS ALSO TOD EMBOFF
THAT THEY THOUGHT ISRAEL SHOULD BE CONGRATULATED BY WORLD
FOR ITS PROMPT AND DECISIVE ATTACK, BUT BOTH ADMITTED THEY
COULD NOT MAKE SUCH STATEMENTS PUBLICLY.
2. EDITORIAL COMMENT HAS BEEN BALANCED. SEMI-OFFICIAL
DAILY RISING NEPAL OFFERED VIEW THAT RAID WILL
STRENGTHEN THE VIEW OF "NO COMPROMISE HARD LINE
IN DEALING WITH HIJACKERS... AND COULD THUS
LEAD TO DISCOURAGING WOULD-BE-HIJACKERS" IN
FUTURE. PAPER ALSO NOTES, HOWEVER, THAT RAID
WAS CLEAR VIOLATION OF UGANDAN SOVEREIGNTY CARRIED
OUT WITH ASSITANCE OF KENYA, FACT WHICH WILL
HAVE SERIOUS REPERCUSSIONS FOR POLITICS IN AFRICA.
EDITORIAL CONCLUDES BY STATING THAT TERRORISM
IS LIEKLY TO PERSIST AS LONG AS ROOT CAUSES
REMAIN UNSOLVED AND CALLS FOR JUST SOLUTION TO PALESTININAN
PROBELM.

 * 23583 1976BEIRUT05822 0.007086108 | 1976-07-03 | BEIRUT | STATE | TALK WITH JUMBLATT JULY 1 SUMMARY: JUMBLATT SPOKE FOR ALMOST 2 HOURS  WITH ME ON WIDE
SUMMARY: JUMBLATT SPOKE FOR ALMOST 2 HOURS WITH ME ON WIDE
RANGE OF SUBJECTS. HE OUTLINED THE "SINS" OF THE CHRISTIANS AND
THE NEED TO REALIZE HOW MUCH THEY HAD TO LOSE IN SPECIFIC TERMS
FROM THEIR CURRENT ALLIANCE WITH THE SYRIANS.  HE ATTACKED
SYRIAN POLICY AND THOUGHT THE FIRST STEP IS THAT SYRIANS GET OUT
BEFORE A ROUND TABLE DISCUSSION CAN PROCEED.  HE WAS
GENERALLY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT CHANCES OF ENDING THE FIGHTING IN THE
NEAR FUTURE (THOUGH GIVING NO SPECIFIC EVIDENCE OF THIS BEYOND
THE GENERAL FEELING THAT "PEOPLE NEED A REST"), AND SAID TIME HAD
COME FOR COMPROMISE. HOWEVER, ROUND TABLE DISCUSSIONS MUST
BE CAREFULLY PREPARED, AND GAVE AS AN EXAMPLE TALKS HE AND THE
PALESTINIANS HAVE HAD WITH BASHIR GEMAYEL, SON OF PIERRE
GEMAYEL. HE OUTLINED SOME REFORMS, INCLUDING PROPORTIONAL
REPRESENTATION AND DE-CONFESSIONALIZATION OF THE STATE, AS
EXAMPLES OVER WHICH COMPROMISE CAN BE REACHED. THOUGH
RESTED AND SPEAKING IN REASONABLE TERMS, HE WAS NOT VERY
CONVINCING THAT PEACE IS AROUND THE CORNER.  END SUMMARY.
1.  I TOOK LAMBRADIS WITH ME TO CALL ON JUMBLATT JULY 1.  HE
LOOKED RESTED AFTER SOMETIME IN HIS MOUNTAIN RETREAT, WHERE
HE WAS NOT VERY INVOLVED WITH CURRENT POLITICS OVER THE PAST
WEEK OR SO.  HE WAS WELL-DRESSED, HAD A NEAT HAIRCUT, AND
GENERALLY PRESENTED A VERY RELAXED IMAGE AS HE OFFERED US
FRUIT AND DEVOURED IT HIMSELF, AS IS HIS AFTERNOON HABIT.
2.  NOTING THAT HE HAD NEVER MET AMBASSADOR MELOY
PERSONALLY, HE BEGAN WITH EXPRESSIONS OF PERSONAL SORROW AT
THE DEATH OF ROBERT WARING.  HE HAD CONSIDERED HIM AN
HONEST FRIEND AND HAD NOTED THINGS HE HAD DISCUSSED WITH
WARING WERE LISTENED TO IN WASHINGTON, SINCE HE HAD SEEN
PLAYBACKS OF THEM A FEW DAYS LATER IN PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS
OR PRESS REPORTS.  WHEN ASKED FOR HIS CURRENT BEST
ESTIMATE OF WHO THE MURDERERS WERE, JUMBLATT SAID HE
THOUGHT THE MURDERS HAD BEEN ORDERED BY DR. HADDAD, WHO
IS GEORGE HABASH'S DEPUTY IN THE PFLP.  HE SAID HE HAD
NOT BEEN IN TOUCH MORE RECENTLY WITH SPECIFICS OF THE
INVESTIGATION, BUT WOULD LOOK INTO IT FOR US.  I PRESSED HIM
ON THIS SCORE, AND HE SEEMED COMPLETELY WILLING TO DO WHAT
HE COULD.  HE NOTED HIS OWN SISTER'S DEATH AND THE WOUNDING
OF HIS NIECES.  SUCH PERSONAL GRIEF HELPS ONE APPRECIATE
THE GRIEF OF OTHERS, HE SAID.
3.  I EXPLAINED MY MISSION TO THE LEBANON, AND NOTED THAT IN
EARLIER CONVERSATIONS SINCE MY ARRIVAL CERTAIN SUGGESTIONS HAD
COME UP ON WHICH I HAD CONSISTENTLY TRIED TO SET THE RECORD
STRAIGHT.  I HAVE BEEN POINTING OUT THAT THE US IS AGAINST
LEBANESE PARTITION.  I HAVE MADE A POINT OF MENTIONING UNITY
OF LEBANON IN MY PUBLIC UTTERANCES.  I ALSO HAVE TRIED TO DEBUNK
LIES SUGGESTING THERE IS A SYRIAN-ISRAELI-CHRISTIAN-USG
CONSPIRACY TO SUPPRESS THE PALESTINIAN AND THE LEFT IN LEBANON.
I NOTED THAT THE PRESS AND RADIO NEVERTHELESS CONTINUED TO INSIST
ON THIS THEME DESPITE ANYTHING THE USG OR I CAN SAY.  JUMBLATT
NODDED HIS UNDERSTANDING.
4.  JUMBLATT ADVERTED INDIRECTLY TO US-SYRIAN COLLUSION.  HE
SAID HE BELIEVED US WHEN WE SAY WE ARE AGAINST PARTITION.
HOWEVER, US USED TO BE VERY STRICT ON QUESTION OF THE
INDEPENDENCE OF LEBANON.  THIS CAME UP IN 1958 EVEN IN
CONNECTION WITH US FACILITATING THE ELECTION OF GENERAL CHEHAB.
ISRAEL HAD BEEN WELL AWARE OVER THE YEARS OF US SUPPORT FOR
LEBANESE INDEPENDENCE.  HOWEVER, THERE HAVE BEEN SOME
CURIOUS EVENTS RECENTLY IN SYRIA.  ASSAD HAS "TURNED COSSACK"
AGAINST THE SOVIETS.  HE HAS RENEWED UNDOF MANDATE ON
GOLAN HEIGHTS WITHOUT ANY FUSS.  ONE CANNOT ESCAPE THE
CONCLUSION THAT US PERMISSION HAS BEEN GIVEN TO SYRIANS TOH
TO VERY FAR INDEED.  EVERYONE BELIEVES THIS, AND JUMBLATT
HAD TOLD THIS TO AMBASSADOR BROWNN WHO HE SAID OF COURSE
DENIED IT.  ONE CANNOT IMAGINE THE SYRIANS WOULD DARE ALLOW
THEIR TROOPS TO ENTER LEBANON WITHOUT SOME KIND OF US
GO-AHEAD. THIS IS A "PLOT" OF WHICH EDDE HAS BEEN TALKING
FOR A YEAR AND A HALF.
6.  JUMBLATT SAID HE BELIEVED SECRETARY KISSINGER HAS A
METHOD WHICH JUMBALTT ADMIRES IN ITS TACTICAL EFFICACY.  IT LETS
PEOPLE FIGHT EACH OTHER UNTIL THEY ARE TIRED AND THEN KISSINGER
STEPS IN WITH A SOLUTION.  BUT US SHOULD BE CAREFUL NOT TO LOSE
ITS FRIENDS IN THE LEBANON.  A SOCIALIST STATE MIGHT RISE IN THE
LEBANON OVER THE NEXT 2 TO 4 YEARS. (IN REPLY TO MY QUESTION,
JUMBLATT INSISTED HE WAS SPEAKING ABOUT A SOCIALIST STATE, NOT
A COMMUNIST.)
7.  SOCIAL REFORM HAD BECOME NECESSARY TO COUNTER MARONITE
PRIVILEGE, WHICH IS EXERCISED IN TERMS REMINISCENT OF THE
MIDDLE AGES.  FIVE PROPRIETORS OWN MOST OF THE BEKAA.  THERE
ARE UNCULTIVATED LANDS GOING TO WASTE WHILE HUNDREDS AND
THOUSANDS ARE MISERABLE IN THEIR POVERTY.  THE COUNTRY NEEDS
TRUE DEMOCRACY.  PROGRESSIVE FORCES WHICH JUMBLATT LEADS
BELIEVE IN LIBERTY.  THEY DO NOT BELIEVE IN COMMUNISM, NOR
CLASS WARFARE, OR IN COUPS D'ETAT.  HE CLAIMED ALONG THAT
LINE TO HAVE PREVENTED GENERAL AHDAB FROM MARCHING AGAINST
FRANGIE WHEN FRANGIE DID NOT RESIGN IN MARCH.  THIS WAS NOT
THE DEMOCRATIC WAY, JUMBLATT SAID.  (AS WE RECALL IT,
JUMBLATT'S GROUP MAY HAVE HAD A PART IN THIS, BUT IT IS FAR
FROM CLEAR THAT HE ALONE PREVENTED AHDAB FROM MARCHING.)
8.  THE MARONITES MUST UNDERSTAND THAT OPPOSITION TO THEM CAN
CONTINUE FOR YEARS IF THEY DO NOT YIELD.  JUMBLATT IS PREPARED
TO DISCUSS THINGS OVER THE ROUND TABLE, BUT NOT TO CONTINUE
ACCEPTING MARONITE MASTERY OF THE COUNTRY.  MARONITES HAVE
SEVERAL SPECIFIC THINGS THEY SHOULD THINK ABOUT: FIRST, IT IS
NOT CLEAR HOW FAR COMMUNISTS MIGHT GO IN LEBANON.
JUMBLATT SAID HE DID NOT LIKE THE COMMUNISTS HIMSELF (AND IN
FACT EXPECTS GREATER DEMOCRATIZATION IN THE SOVIET UNION BY
ABOUT 1985).  HOWEVER, MARONITES SHOULD FEAR COMMUNIST
TREND IN LEBANON IF CONDITIONS ON WHICH THEY BREED ARE NOT
CHANGED.  SECOND, MARONITES SHOULD FEAR EMIGRATION OF THEIR
OWN PEOPLE IF THEY MAINTAIN CURRENT SEPARATENESS BEHIND
THEIR GUNS.  JUMBLATT WAS TOLD 80 PERCENT OF DOCTORS HAVE
ALREADY FLED THE COUNTRY.  THESE STUBBORN
MARONITES MAY SOME DAY FIND THEIR NUMBERS
SO REDUCED THAT THEY WILL BE FACED BY A CRUSHING
MAJORITY OF ISLAM.  THIRD, MARONITES SHOULD FEAR SYRIA.
SOME SUCH AS BASHIR GEMAYEL WISELY OPPOSED SYRIAN
INTERVENTION FOR THIS REASON; OTHERS -- PARTICULARLY THE
MONKS AND CLERICS OF THE CATHOLIC FRONT -- MAINTAIN THEIR
HOPES FOR A NEW CRUSADE.  SYRIANS BELIEVE THEY HAVE A CHANCE
TO REPLACE MOTHER FRANCE AS PROTECTOR OF LEBANON, AND IN
PARTICULAR THE MARONITES.  BUT ONE DAY THERE COULD BE A CHANGE
OF REGIME IN SYRIA WITH SUNNIS OVERTHROWING THE REGIME AND
LIVING UP THEIR FORCES IN LEBANON WITH THE LEFT.  TOP
CHRISTIAN LEADERS SHOULD REALIZE THIS.  (COMMENTING
SPECIFICALLY ON GEMAYEL, JUMBLATT SAID HE SUFFERED FROM
HALLUCINATIONS AND HAD NO INTELLECTUAL BAGGAGE.  CLINICALLY HIS
FATHER HAD SUFFERED FROM HALLUCINATIONS.)
9.  FINALLY, CHRISTIANS SHOULD REALIZE FORTUNE THEY MADE IN
THE PAST WAS BASED ON EXPLOITATION OF ARAB OIL AND SERVICES TO
OTHER ARAB COUNTRIES.  MARONITES HAVE LOST MUCH OF THIS
MONEY (HE SPOKE OF 50,000 LEBANESE IN FRANCE, MANY OF
THEM IN FINANCIAL NEED AT PRESENT).  MARONITES MUST REALIZE
THAT THESE ARAB STATES WILL TURN AGAINST EHEM AND ISOLATE
THEM IF THEY CONTINUE TO BEHAVE AS THEY DO.  JUMBLATT
HIMSELF HAD TO INTERVENE SOME MONTHS AGO FOR FRIENDS WHO WERE
ABOUT TO BE EXPELLED FROM LIBYA AND KUWAIT.

10.  TROUBLE WITH MARONITES, JUMBLATT SUMMED UP, IS THAT THEY
ARE OBSESSED BY FEAR.  SARKIS MAY TURN OUT TO BE THE LAST
MARONITE PRESIDENT OF LEBANON.  THEY MADE A BIG MISTAKE IN
CURRENT ATTACK ON TELL ZAATAR, WHICH HE WAS SORRY TO SEE
BASHIR GEMAYEL ALSO JOINED IN ON FINALLY.  MUSLIMS COULD HAVE
DONE NASTY THINGS TO CHRISTIAN VILLAGES SUCH AS DEIR EL-QAMAR
(IN THE CHOUF), BUT THEY WOULD NOT.  NOR WOULD MUSLIMS ATTACK
CHRISTIANS IN RAS BEIRUT, AS MANY SEEMED TO FEAR.  MARONITES
MUST HAVE CONFIDENCE IN DEMOCRACY AND ACCEPT WESTERNIZING
THE COUNTRY INSTITUTIONS.  BY THIS HE MEANT REFORMS TO SUPPRESS
SECTARIANISM AND ESTABLISH GOVERNMENT ON MODERN PRINCIPLES.
11.  I ASKED HIM IF HE HAD NOT ACCEPTED THE COMPROMISE AGREEMENT
ANNOUNCED LAST FEBRUARY BY FRANGIE.  JUMBLATT SAID THOSE POINTS
HAD BEEN ACCEPTABLE THEN, BUT CHRISTIANS HAD REJECTED THEM, AND
SITUATION HAS CHANGED.  THE LEFT ALLIANCES PARTIES WILL NO LONGER
ACCEPT THEM.  IN THIS SENSE MARONITES ARE ARABS, AND HAVE BEEN
ACTING AS ARABS HAVE ACTED HISTORICALLY TOWARDS ISRAEL --
THEY ACCEPT NOTHING UNTIL IT IS TOO LATE.
12.  COURSE AHEAD, JUMBLATT SAID, MUST BE TO PREPARE A
COMPROMISE AGREEMENT.  THIS MUST BE PRECEDED BY NEGOTIATIONS
THROUGH QUIET OR PUBLIC CONTACTS BETWEEN THE SIDES, BEFORE FINAL
AGREEMENT IS BROUGHT TO A ROUND TABLE AND SANCTIONED THERE.
THEN THERE SHOULD BE A NEW PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION ACCORDING
TO THE NEW PRINCIPLES AGREED UPON.  WHEN ASKED TO SPECIFY
REFORMS HE WANTED, HE MENTIONED PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION
IN PARLIAMENT WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF GETTING MORE YOUNG PEOPLE
IN.  HOWEVER, THIS SHOULD BE LIMITED TO NO MORE THAN THREE
PARTIES BEING ELECTED, AND LIST SHOULD PERMIT VOTERS TO EXPRESS
INDIVIDUAL PREFERENCES FOR PEOPLE ON THE LIST.  A SECOND CHAMBER
SHOULD BE CREATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS WELL-PUBLICIZED
PROGRAM.  OBJECTIVE IS TO ABOLISH CONFESSIONALISM AND
ELEIMINATE MEDIOCRITY IN PARLIAMENT.  I ASKED IF HE MEANT
ELIMINATING FEUDAL REMNANTS.  NO, JUMBLATT INSISTED, HE MEANT
ELIMINATING MEDIOCRITY. (COMMENT: JUMBLATT OF COURSE
DERIVES HIS MOST STEADY SUPPORT FROM HIS TRADITIONAL FEUDAL
SUZERAINTY OVER MUCH OF THE DRUZE COMMUNITY).
13.  PHALANGE (PROBABLY BASHIR GEMAYEL) HAS ACCEPTED
PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION, JUMBLATT ASSERTED, BUT NOT
AN END TO CONFESSIONALISM.  JUMBLATT THOUGH PARTIES OF THE
LEFT CAN IMPOSE ON OTHER, MORE CONSERVATIVE MUSLIMS A REFORM
PROGRAM WHICH WOULD, FOR EXAMPLE, PERMIT CIVIL MARRIAGE AND
SIMILAR CHANGES WHICH MANY CHRISTIANS SUPPORT.  YOUNG
PEOPLE, BOTH CHRISTIAN AND MUSLIM, ARE IDEALISTIC.  THEY WILL
INSIST ON TOUGH REFORMS.  THERE IS LITTLE DIFFERNENCE BETWEEN
THESE YOUNG PEOPLE, EXCEPT THAT THE CHRISTIAN YOUTH DO NOT
UNDERSTAND THE PALESTINIANS AND HOW TO HANDLE THEM.
MEANWHILE, COMPETITION AMONG TRADITIONAL CHRISTIAN LEADDERS
SUCH AS CHAMOUN AND GEMAYEL LENDS TO ESCALATION OF RHETORIC
AND MILITARY ACTION FOR NO GOOD REASON.  THIS SHOULD END.
14.  AS TO PALESTINIANS, ELIMINATION OF SAIQA HAS BEEN A GOOD
THING.  OF COURSE SOME GROUPS SUCH AS PFLP RESORT
INOPPORTUNELY TO TERRORISM (HERE JUMBLATT SHOWED HE DID
NOT APPROVE RECENT AIR FRANCE HIJACKING).  THERE ARE ALSO
TROUBLE-MAKING SMALL GROUPS BACKED BY LIBYANS AND IRAQIS
AS WELL AS SYRIANS.  HOWEVER, WITH SAIQA DISAPPEARANCE,
PALESTINIANS CAN NOW IMPOSE THEIR OWN LAW AMONG MOST OF
THEIR PEOPLE.  LEBANESE MUST LEARN HOW TO DEAL WITH
PALESTINIANS, OFFER THEM A BETTER LIFE.  THIS IS AN IMPORTANT
PEOPLE NUMBERING THREE MILLION THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.  THEY DO
NOT WANT TO LIVE HERE ONLY AS AN ARMY.  IN THIS SENSE, JUMBLATT
SAID HE HAD NO FEAR FOR THE FUTURE OF THE COUNTRY.  PEOPLE MAY
EVEN HAVE BENEFITED FROM THEIR EXORCISM OF BLOOD....
15.  SPECIFICALLY, JUMBLATT SAID, 1969 DAIRO ACCORD IS OUT OF
DATE,  BUT MODUS VIVENDI CAN BE REACHED WITH PALESTINIANS.  HE
NOTED THAT PALESTINIANS REMAIN IN TOUCH WITH CHRISTIANS THROUGH
ABU HASSAN WHO GOES BACK AND FORTH ACROSS THE DIVIDING LINE,
AS DOES PHALANGE'S BAYIR GEMAYEL.  HE THEN MADE SOME
REMARKS ABOUT A VIABLE PALESTINIAN STATE TO INCLUDE JORDAN,
AND THE 1,200,000 PALESTINIANS HAVING A COANCE TO RETURN TO
THEIR HOMES IN HAIFA, ETC. ETC. (JUMBLATT IS CLEARLY BEYOND
HIS DEPTH OR INTEREST WHEN HE STARTS TALKING ABOUT THE LARGER
PALESTINIAN PROBLEM).
16.  SPECIFICALLY ON SYRIANS, JUMBLATT SAID THAT THEY MUST LEAVE
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  ALL MUSLIMS ARE AGAINST THEM.  ASSAD IS
A MEDIOCRE MAN WHO HAS REPEATEDLY REFUSED TO TAKE
OPPORTUNITIES TO GET OUT OF THE LEBANON.  AS TO REASONS FOR
SYRIAN INTERVENTION, JUMBLATT SPECULATED, SOME SAY SYRIA
WANTS THE BEKAA.  OTHERS SAY SYRIA WISHES TO REPLACE FRANCE
AND HAS TAKEN THIS HISTORIC OPPORTUNITY TO GET CLOSE TO THE
MARONITES.  JUMBLATT CLAIMED ASSAD HAS SPECIFICALLY
TOLD HIM THIS ON FREQUENT OCCASIONS WHILE THEY WERE STILL IN
CONTACT, AS OF A FEW MONTHS AGO.  ALSO, ASSAD HOPED TO WIN
A CARD IN HIS DIPLOMATIC GAME, GOING TO FRANCE AS A FRIEND OF
JORDAN ON THE ONE HAND AND WITH CONTROL OVER LEBANON AND THE
PALESTINIANS ON THE OTHER.  THIS WOULD HAVE HELPED HIM IN US
EYES TOO AND MAYBE HELPED GET A GOLAN SETTLEMENT OF THE KIND
HE WANTS.  HOWEVER, EGYPT IS NOW BEGINNING TO REPLACE
SYRIA IN THE LEBANON AS IS NORMAL.  AT LEAST SADAT IN HIS
SINAI II POLICY WAS FRANK.  HE HAS WON MUCH RESPECT.
17.  JUMBLATT TENDED TO DOWN-PLAY THE PROBLEM OF SECURITY
IN LEBANON.  HE SAID THE VARIOUS PARTIES ARE BEGINNING TO TAKE
SECURITY IN HAND.  THERE ARE FEWER ASSASSINATIONS NOW AND LOOTING
IS LESS BOTH IN BEIRUT AND IN THE MOUNTAINS.  THE LEBANESE
ARMY WILL BE REBUILT.  THE POPULACE, ONCE IT HAS PEACE, WILL
SELL ITS ARMS.  WITH $20 MILLION, JUMBLATT SAID, THE STATE
COULD BUY BACK THE ARMS ITSELF.  PEOPLE ARE HUNGRY.  AGAIN
HE RETURNED TO HIS THEME THAT YOUNG PEOPLE MUST BE ALLOWED
TO TAKE POWER IN THIS COUNTRY.
18.  FINALLY, JUMBLATT WISHED ME WELL.  HE SAID DEAN BROWN
DID A GOOD JOB HERE.  HE PERHAPS LACKED PATIENCE.  IT IS
BETTER TOWORK A LITTLE MORE SLOWLY AND PATIENTLY AND PERHAPS
WITH LOWER PROFILE, BUT US CAN BE HELPFUL.
19.  SUMMING UP HIS VIEWS, JUMBLATT SAID HE EXPECTED THE
WAR TO END SOON.  EVEN THOUGH HE ADMITTED HIS OWN AIMS ARE
WHAT AMOUNT TO A CONTINUOUS REVOLUTION UNTIL POWER MOVES
FROM THE HANDS OF THE MARONITES TO HIS OWN AND THOSE OF
OTHERS ALLIED WITH HIM, HE THOUGHT MEDITERRANEAN PEOPLE
SUCH AS THE LEBANESE AND PALESTINIANS NEED A REST.  TIME
HAS COME FOR COMPROMISE, AND HE IS PREPARED FOR THAT.
WHEN I ASKED WHETHER CONCENTRATED BITTERNESS BETWEEN
FACTIONS MIGHT NOT IMPEDE COMPROMISE, HE SAID PEOPLE
TEND TO FORGET THE CARNAGE, BLOOD, AND DESTRUCTION,
PARTICULARLY IF A CATASTROPHE IS BIG ENOUGHT.  MEANWHILE
NOTHING CAN BE DONE BY WAY OF FORMAL PEACEMAKING UNTIL
THE SYRIANS WITHDRAW TOTALLY FROM THE LEBANON.
20.  COMMENT:  AS I HAVE BEEN TOLD TO EXPECT, JUMBLATT
HAS AN UNCANNILY WINNING PERSONALITY.  IT IS HARD TO DISLIKE THE
MAN FACE TO FACE.  HE HAS MANY MOODS AND MANY GUISES AND
SEEMS TO BE SPEAKING FRANKLY AT ALL TIMES.  HOWEVER, WHAT HE
SAID OFTEN STRUCK ME AS UNREALISTIC TO SAY THE LEAST.  IN
PARTICULAR, I WAS STRUCK BY HIS GREAT OPTIMISM TO ME IN VIEW
OF HIS SIMULTANEOUS PUBLIC PRONOUNCEMENTS THAT THE WAR WILL
CONTINUE AND VIETNAMIZATION MAY RESULT IF THE CHRISTIANS DO NOT
STOP THEIR ATTACK ON TELL XAATAR.  HE IS CLEARLY A MAN WHOSE
WORDS SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN AT FACE VALUE.  BUT HE IS ALSO A
LEADER WHO SEEMS INDISPENSIBLE IN THE CURRENT POLITICAL
MAKEUP HERE.  HE IS OUT TO BECOME NUMBER ONE IN THE LEBANON,
EVEN IF THIS TAKES A FEW MORE YEARS.

(C) MAPUTO 746 (NOTAL)
1. AT RECEPTION HOSTED BY PRESIDENT AMIN FOLLOWING OAU SUMMIT
OPENING SESSION EVENING JULY 2 I APPROACHED WALDHEIM AND HAD BRIEF
EXCHANGE WITH HIM RE ENTEBBE HIJACKING SITUATION. HE SAID: "PLEASE
TELL YOUR SECRETARY OF STATE THAT I AM DOING ALL IN MY POWER TO BE
HELPFUL." HE HAD HAD NO DIRECT NEWS SINCE DEPARTING MAPUTO EARLIER
IN DAY. WALDHEIM SAID HE HAD HAD A BRIEF CONVERSATION WITH AMIN
PRIOR TO OAU SUMMIT OPENING SESSION AND THEY HAD SCHEDULED ANOTHER
MEETING FOR THIS MORNING (10 A.M. LOCAL JULY 3). WALDHEIM
REMARKED THAT AMIN "LIKES TO RUN THE WHOLE SHOW," SO IT IS
DIFFICULT TO GET HIM TO DO WHAT ONE WANTS. WALDHEIM THOUGHT
THERE WAS SOME ADVANTAGE IN THE FACT THAT THE UNDP REP IN
KAMPALA WHOM HE HAD INSTRUCTED TO GET INVOLVED IS AN AFRICAN
(GHANAIAN). HE ALSO REMARKED THAT AMIN HAD SAID HE WANTED THE
ISRAELIS TO COME TO KAMPALA TO NEGOTIATE.
2. NEITHER AMIN NOR WALDHEIM ATTENDED A MAURITIAN CEREMONY WHICH
PRECEDED FIRST WORKING SESSION OF OAU SUMMIT MORNING OF JULY 3.
3. ALSO HAD A BRIEF ENCOUNTER WITH AMIN AT HIS RECEPTION. EXCHANGE
WAS FRIENDLY, REMARKABLY SO CONSIDERING THAT AT OUR LAST MEETING
IN KAMPALA IN OCTOBER 1973 HE THREATENED TO ARREST ALL AMERICANS
IN UGANDA STARTING WITH ME IF U.S. INTERVENED ON SIDE OF ISRAEL
IN WAR THEN UNDERWAY IN MIDDLE EAST. AMIN INVITED ME TO KAMPALA
AND SAID HE NOW HAS FIFTY AMERICANS IN UGANDA ADVISING HIS AIR
FORCE. A MEMBER OF HIS ENTOURAGE (BYAGAGAIRE) LATER CORRECTED
THIS TO ABOUT FIVE AMERICANS PROVIDING TECHNICAL HELP
AND SERVING AS PILOTS FOR THEIR NEW INTERNAL AIRLINE,
AIR UGANDA.
4. AMIN DISCUSSED HIJACKING IN COURSE OF HIS EXTEMPORANEOUS
REMARKS AT OAU OPENING. IN A BOASTFUL FASHION, HE MADE
FOLLOWING POINTS: (A) ALTHOUGH HE HAD NOT INVITED HIJACKERS
TO UGANDA, HE HAD PERMITTED PLANE TO LAND FOR HUMANITARIAN
REASONS; (B) FACT THAT EUROPEANS WERE AMONG HIJACKERS SHOWED
THAT PALESTINIANS ENJOY WORLD-WIDE SUPPORT; (C) FOR FIRST TIME
IN HISTORY HOSTAGES HAVE BEEN PERMITTED TO LEAVE PLANE AND
SEEK COMFORT IN AIRPORT TRANSIT LOUNGE; (D) HE HAD WORKED
HARD TO GET AS MANY HOSTAGES RELEASED AS POSSIBLE;
(E) HE HAD COMPLIED WITH HIJACKERS' DEMANDS REGARDING
RELEASE OF ONLY PART OF HOSTAGE GROUP BECAUSE THEY
WERE "SURROUNDED" BY EXPLOSIVES AND WERE IN DANGER OF BEING
KILLED; (F) "SOME OF THE ISRAELI HOSTAGES ARE "INNOCENT", SO
THEY SHOULD NOT BE KILLED; (G) AS A RESULT OF THIS INCIDENT, HE
HAD RECEIVED SEVERAL PHONE CALLS FROM ISRAEL, FOR FIRST TIME
SINCE HE HAD BROKEN RELATIONS WITH ISRAEL IN 1972. AMIN
REMARKED THAT HE WOULD PROBABLY NOT BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE
FULLY IN OAU SUMMIT AS HE HAD A PROBLEM AT HOME THAT HE HAD
TO DEAL WITH. THIS HAS LED TO SPECULATION THAT AMIN WILL
RETURN TO KAMPALA, POSSIBLY TODAY, JULY 3, TO CONTINUE
DEALING WITH HIJACKERS. A MEMBER OF HIS DELEGATION (PAUL
ETIANG) TOLD ME LAST NIGHT THAT THIS WAS PROBABLE.

 * 309235 1976TELAV04701 0.007085381 | 1976-07-07 | TEL AVIV | STATE | CABINET AND KNESSET TO RECONSIDER DEATH PENALTY FOR TERRORISTS
TERRORISTS
SUMMARY: FOLLOWING THE ENTEBBE EPISODE, A NUMBER OF
MINISTERS AND KNESSET MEMBERS HAVE PROPOSED THAT THE
GOVERNMENT REVIEW ITS POLICY ON DEATH PENALTY FOR TERRORIST
KILLERS.  MINISTERYFREPORTEDLY ARE RELUCTANT TO HOLD A
FULL SCALE DEBATE ON THE SUBJECT UNDER THE IMMEDIATE IMPACT OF THE
ENTEBBE OPERATION, BUT IS EXPECTED THAT THE MATTER
WILL BE PLACED ON THE CABINET AGENDA WITHIN A FEW WEEKS.
END SUMMARY.
1.  ISRAELI LAW PROVIDES FOR CAPITAL PUNISHMENT BUT IT
HAS BEEN GOVERNMENT POLICY NOT TO APPLY IT IN PRACTICE.
JUSTICE MINISTER ZADOK, REVIEWING THE GOVERNMENT'S
POSITION IN JULY 6 KNESSET DEBATE, RECALLED THAT ON
OCTOBER 29, 1967, THE ESHKOL GOVERNMENT HAD INSTRUCTED
PROSECUTORS TO WITHOLD REQUESTS FOR EXECUTION OF
CONVICTED TERRORISTS.  THE RABIN GOVERNMENT REAFFIRMED
THIS POLICY ON AUGUST 4, 1974.  (INDEED, AS FAR AS THIS
EMBASSY KNOWS, THERE HAVE BEEN ONLY TWO CASES OF CAPITAL
EXECUTIONS IN ISRAEL'S HISTORY--THE FIRST WAS AN ISRAELI
CHARGED WITH TREASON DURING THE WAR OF INDEPENDENCE
AND POSTHUMOUSLY FOUND TO HAVE BEEN INNOCENT AND THE
SECOND WAS ADOLF EICHMAN IN 1962.)
2.  PRIME MINISTER RABIN REFERRED BRIEFLY TO THE NEED
FOR A POLICY REVIEW IN A JULY 5 MEETING OF THE LABOR
ALIGNMENT EXECUTIVE.  HE GAVE NO INDICATION, HOWEVER,
AS TO HIS OWN VIEWS ON THE MATTER.  DEFENSE MINISTER PERES
IN A SPEECH ON JULY 6 SAID THAT HIS PERSONAL VIEW WAS
THAT ISRAEL SHOULD REFRAIN FROM EXECUTINLRTERRORISTS
EXCEPT FOR UNUSUAL CASES SUCH AS THAT OF THE JAPANESE
TERRORIST KOZO OKAMOTO WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE 1972 LOD
AIRPORT MASSACRE.
3.  JUSTICE MINISTER HAIM ZADOK TOLD THE KNESSET THAT HE
WAS NOT IMPOSED TO THE DEATH PENALTY FOR TERRORISTS "ON
PRINCIPLE OR ON HUMANITARIAN GROUNDS..."HE ADDED THAT
"AS THINGS STAND NOW, SHYING AWAY FROM THE DEATH PENALTY FOR
TERRORISTS IS NOT A LAW BUT A MATTER OF GOVERNMENT
POLICY.  IT MAY BE ADVISABLE TO REVIEW THAT POLICY NOW, NOT
IN THE HEAT OF EMOTION, BUT IN A DVBUBERATE MANNER...
FOR ME, THE ONLY CONSIDERAT*, 8 , WILL IT (THE DEATH
PENALTY) AID IN OUR FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM?"
4.  JERUSALEM POST CORRESPONDENTS WALLFISH AND LANDAU
WRITE ON JULY 6 THAT THE CURRENT DEBATE IS A RESULT
OF THE REALIZATION "THAT THE TERROR GROUP RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE UGANDA HIJACK IS AN UNPRECEDENTEDLY SOPHISTICATED
AS
DETERMENED GANG OF INTERNATIONAL OUTLAWS--NOT ALL
PALESTINIANS--WHO ARE LIKELY TO TRY SIMILAR ACTIONS AGAIN...
THOSE WHO FAVOR A REVIEW OF THE DEATH PENALTY POLICY
ARGUE THAT THE PRESENCE IN ISRAEL OF SUCH 'SPECTACULAR'
KILLERS AS ILAMOTO SERVES AS A INNSTANT INCENTIVE AND
INCITEMENT FOR FURTHER HIJACK ATTEMPTS...AT THE SAME
TIME, HOWEVER, HUMANITARIAN AND MORAL CONSIDERATIONS
WHICH HAVE GUIDED ISRAEL AWAY FROM EVER IMPLEMENTING
THE DEATH
PENALTY STILL POWERDELLY AFFECT POLICYMAKERS."
5.  THE LIKUD EXECUTIVE JULY 5 UNANIMOUSLY VOTED IN
FAVOR OF APPLYING THE DEATH PENALTY FOR TERRORISTS AND
HAS DEMANDED AN URGENT KNESSET DEBATE ON THE SUBJECT.
6.  COMMENT: PUBLIC DEBATE OVER THE MERITS OF THE
DEATH PENALTY FOR TERRORISTS INEVITABLY SURFACES IN
THE WAKE OF MAJOR TERRORISTS OPERATIONS.  THE ISSUE
WAS VIGOROUSLY ARGUED AFTER DVE KIRYAT SHMONA AND MAALOT
MASSACURES IN THE SPRING OF 1974 WHICH INVOLVED THE
DEATH OF CHILDREN AND TEENAGERS.  IN THE PRESENT INSTANCE,
THERE IS AGAIN A GROUNDSWELL OF SENTIMENT IN FAVOR OF
REVERSING GOVERNMENT POLICY.   THE FINAL DECISION, HOWEVER,
WILL REST WITH RABIN WHO, ON THIS PARTICULAR
MATTER, IS LIKELY TO CONSULT CLOSELY WITH JUSTICE
MINISTER ZADOK.

TEXT FOLLOWS:
2.  QUOTE: THE MINISTER OF TRANSPORT, MR. GAD YAAKOBI,
TODAY (MONDAY) DESPATCHED NOTES TO HIS OPPOSITE NUMBERS
IN THE U.S., FRANCE, ITALY, DENMARK, FINLAND, GREECE,
TURKEY AND CYPRUS, ASKING THEM TO INCREASE CIVIL AVIATION
SECURITY MEASURES AT AIRPORTS AND IN FLIGHT.
IN HIS NOTE, THE MINISTER OF TRANSPORT POINTS OUT THAT
EVENTS LEADING FROM THE AIR FRANCE AIRLINER'S HIJACKING
OVER ATHENS, VIA BEHGHAZI, TO ENTEBBE, UGANDA, ILLUSTRATED
AGAIN THE URGENT NEED FOR INTENSIFYING SECURITY MEASURES
TAKEN BY AIRLINES AND AIRPORTS.  THE LIVES AND WELLBEING
OF MILLIONS DEPENDED ON ADEQUATE SECURITY MEASURES.
TRANSPORT MINISTERS, COMPETENT AUTHORITIES AND CARRIERS
WERE CHARGED WITH THE PROPER FUNCTIONING OF CIVIL AVIATION,
ACCOMPANIED BY MAXIMUM CARE FOR THEIR PASSENGERS.
THE ISRAEL GOVERNMENT IS DOING EVERYTHING IN ITS POWER
TO SAFEGUARD THOSE PASSING ITS AIRPORTS AND TRAVELLING
BY ITS NATIONAL CARRIER, INCLUDING MANY CITIZENS OF YOUR
COUNTRY.  I THEREFORE FEEL PERMITTED AND OBLIGED TO APPEAL
TO YOU, AS THE (MINISTER) RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR COUNTRY'S
CIVIL AVIATION, TO STRIVE FOR SECURITY IN AIR TRAVEL.
UNQUOTE.
3.  JERUSALEM POST STORY JULY 6 REPORTED THAT TRANSPORT MINISTRY
HAD ASKED FOREIGN AIRLINES TO SKIP INTERMEDIATE ROUTE
STOPS WHERE SECURITY WAS INADEQUATE.  HOWEVER, LOCAL TWA
MANAGER HAS INFORMED US THAT NO SUCH SUGGESTION HAS BEEN
MADE TO TWA.  AIR FRANCE, WHICH HALTED ATHENS STOPOVERS
FOR FLIGHTS ORIGINATING IN ISRAEL IN IMMEDIATE WAKE OF
HIJACKING, HAS REPORTEDLY RESUMED THEM.

1. REFTEL (A) JUST RECEIVED. ASSUME NO ACTION IS TO BE

2. GOE, IN PERSON OF FAHMY, HAS PUBLICLY CONDEMNED
ISRAELI OPERATION. HIS EVEN STRONGER DENUNCIATION,
AS GIVEN TO AMBASSADOR, WAS REPORTED REFTEL B (EXDIS).
HE DISMISSES PUBLIC CHARGES OF UGANDAN COLLABORATION
WITH HIJACKERS AS ISRAELI FABRICATIONS INTENDED JUSTIFY
WHAT HE REGARDS AS AN ILLEGAL ISRAELI ACTION. FAHMY'S
REACTION IS BASED PARTLY ON CHAGRIN THAT ISRAELIS COULD
SUCCESSFULLY MOUNT SUCH AN OPERATION AND PARTLY ON OAU
CONSIDERATIONS. HE HAS SAID THAT GOE WILL SUPPORT
UGANDAN CALL FOR UNSC MEETING IF SUCH CALL IS MADE.
AT SUCH MEETING, GOE MAY BE EXPECTED ASSOCIATE ITSELF
WITH THOSE DEMANDING A RESOLUTION CONDEMNING ISRAELI
ACTION.
3. AT SAME TIME, GOE IS PUBLICLY ON RECORD AS OPPOSING
TERRORISM, WHICH WOULD BE PEG ON WHICH A DEMARCHE COULD
BE HUNG TO REQUEST SUPPORT FOR AN OPERATIVE PARA RE
EVERY GOVERNMENT'S OBLIGATION TO END ACTS OF TERRORISM.
PROBLEM THIS INSTANCE WILL BE THAT, DESPITE GENERAL
NATURE OF PROPOSED PARA, GOE WILL RECOGNIZE IT IS
DIRECTED AGAINST UGANDA AND WILL PROBABLY OPPOSE IT.
IF THERE IS TO BE ANY CHANCE OF GETTING GOE TO GO ALONG,
WE WILL HAVE TO PROVIDE
FAHMY WITH SOME STRONG EVIDENCE
OF UGANDAN INVOLVEMENT IN AIDING AND ABETTING HIJACKERS.
EVEN WITH CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE TO THAT EFFECT, GOE MAY
STILL FIND IT POLITICALLY NECESSARY FOLLOW OAU CONSENSUS.

OPERATION
REFERENCE: STATE 166529
1.  ACTING DCM AND POLITICAL COUNSELOR CALLED ON GOP
ADDITIONAL FOREIGN SECRETARY NIAZ NAIK ON JULY 6 AND
MADE POINTS DRAWN FROM REFTEL, PARAS 1-5.  NAIK INDICATED
GOP COULD NOT SUPPORT PROPOSED US DRAFT RESOLUTION.
2.  NAIK TOOK A VERY HARDLINE AGAINST ISRAELI ACTION.
HE SAID GOP COULD NOT PUT THE HIJACKING AND THE
SUBSEQUENT ISRAELI OPERATION ON SAME PLANE.  OFFICIAL
GOP POSITION, HE SAID, HAD ALREADY BEEN SPELLED OUT IN
PRESS STATEMENT JUST RELEASED,  TEXT OF WHICH HAD BEEN
CABLED TO PAK PERMREP IN NEW YORK.  GOP HAD ALSO SENT
INSTRUCTIONS TO PERMREP ON BASIS PRESS STATEMENT
TELLING HIM TO SUPPORT A DRAFT RESOLUTION CONDEMNING
ISRAEL.  PERMREP HAS BEEN INFORMED PAKISTAN'S
POSITION RE KENYA WOULD DEPEND ON THE CASE WHICH IS
DEVELOPED AGINST GOK.  PERMREP HAS BEEN TOLD TO
SEEK INSTRUCTIONS ON THIS POINT WHEN THE ACTUAL
RESOLUTION IS DRAFTED.  NAIK SAID THAT HIS INFORMATION
WAS THAT THERE WOULD BE NO DIRECT REFERENCE TO KENYA,
JUST A CONDEMNATION OF "THOSE WHO HAD SUPPORTED"  THE
ISRAELI OPERATION.
3.  TEXT OF THE GOP STATEMENT "CONDEMNING ISRAEL'S
TERRORIST ATTACK AGAINST THE PEOPLE OF UGANDA " FOLLOWS:
" THE GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN EXPRESSES ITS SENSE OF
PROFOUND SHOCK OVER ISRAEL'S BRAZEN ACT OF AGGRESSION
AGAINST THE PEOPLE AND THE STATE SOVEREIGNTY OF UGANDA.
ISRAELI ARMED FORCES ATTACKED THE ENTEBBE AIRPORT IN
UGANDA ON THE NIGHT OF JULY 3 CAUSING SERIOUS DAMAGE TO
LIFE AND PROPERTY THERE.  DRAWING ATTENTION TO ITS
CONSISTENT OPPOSITION TO ISRAEL'S POLICY OF AGGRESSION,
THE GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN CONDEMNS THE ISRAELI ATTACK
ON THE ENTEBBE AIRPORT AND EXPRESSES PAKISTAN'S
SOLIDARITY WITH THE GOVERNMENT AND THE PEOPLE OF UGANDA.
THIS BLATANT AGGRESSION DEMONSTRATED ONCE AGAIN
ISRAEL'S TOTAL DISREGARD FOR THE PRINCIPLES OF
SOVEREIGNTY AND TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY OF STATES AND
ITS LACK OF RESPECT FOR AFRICAN AND ARAB LIVES.
"THIS WAS, HOWEVER, NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT ISRAEL
HAD VIOLATED, WITH TOTAL IMPUNITY, THE CHARTER OF
THE UNITED NATIONS AND HAD LAUNCHED UNPROVOKED AGGRESSION
AGAINST A SOVEREIGN STATE.  THE LAST TWENTY-EIGHT
YEARS ABOUND WITH INNUMERABLE ACTS OF AGGRESSION
COMMITTED BY ISRAEL IN FURTHERANCE OF ITS EXPANSIONIST
DESIGNS.  THE LATEST ACT OF ISRAELI AGGRESSION WAS
SPECIALLY SHOCKING SINCE PRESIDENT IDI AMIN HAD
PERSONALLY BEEN NEGOTIATING THE RELEASE OF THE
HOSTAGES WITH THE HIJACKERS AND HAD ALREADY SUCCEEDED
IN SECURING THE RELEASE OF OVER 150 PERSONS."
4.  IN FURTHER DISCUSSION, NAIK REITERATED THAT GOP
DRAWS A DISTINCTION BETWEEN HIJACKINGS BY INDIVIDUAL
TERRORISTS, WHICH IT CONDEMNS, AND THOSE CARRIED OUT BY

OPERATION
REFERENCE: STATE 166529
1.  ACTING DCM AND POLITICAL COUNSELOR CALLED ON GOP
ADDITIONAL FOREIGN SECRETARY NIAZ NAIK ON JULY 6 AND
MADE POINTS DRAWN FROM REFTEL, PARAS 1-5.  NAIK INDICATED
GOP COULD NOT SUPPORT PROPOSED US DRAFT RESOLUTION.
2.  NAIK TOOK A VERY HARDLINE AGAINST ISRAELI ACTION.
HE SAID GOP COULD NOT PUT THE HIJACKING AND THE
SUBSEQUENT ISRAELI OPERATION ON SAME PLANE.  OFFICIAL
GOP POSITION, HE SAID, HAD ALREADY BEEN SPELLED OUT IN
PRESS STATEMENT JUST RELEASED,  TEXT OF WHICH HAD BEEN
CABLED TO PAK PERMREP IN NEW YORK.  GOP HAD ALSO SENT
INSTRUCTIONS TO PERMREP ON BASIS PRESS STATEMENT
TELLING HIM TO SUPPORT A DRAFT RESOLUTION CONDEMNING
ISRAEL.  PERMREP HAS BEEN INFORMED PAKISTAN'S
POSITION RE KENYA WOULD DEPEND ON THE CASE WHICH IS
DEVELOPED AGINST GOK.  PERMREP HAS BEEN TOLD TO
SEEK INSTRUCTIONS ON THIS POINT WHEN THE ACTUAL
RESOLUTION IS DRAFTED.  NAIK SAID THAT HIS INFORMATION
WAS THAT THERE WOULD BE NO DIRECT REFERENCE TO KENYA,
JUST A CONDEMNATION OF "THOSE WHO HAD SUPPORTED"  THE
ISRAELI OPERATION.
3.  TEXT OF THE GOP STATEMENT "CONDEMNING ISRAEL'S
TERRORIST ATTACK AGAINST THE PEOPLE OF UGANDA " FOLLOWS:
" THE GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN EXPRESSES ITS SENSE OF
PROFOUND SHOCK OVER ISRAEL'S BRAZEN ACT OF AGGRESSION
AGAINST THE PEOPLE AND THE STATE SOVEREIGNTY OF UGANDA.
ISRAELI ARMED FORCES ATTACKED THE ENTEBBE AIRPORT IN
UGANDA ON THE NIGHT OF JULY 3 CAUSING SERIOUS DAMAGE TO
LIFE AND PROPERTY THERE.  DRAWING ATTENTION TO ITS
CONSISTENT OPPOSITION TO ISRAEL'S POLICY OF AGGRESSION,
THE GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN CONDEMNS THE ISRAELI ATTACK
ON THE ENTEBBE AIRPORT AND EXPRESSES PAKISTAN'S
SOLIDARITY WITH THE GOVERNMENT AND THE PEOPLE OF UGANDA.
THIS BLATANT AGGRESSION DEMONSTRATED ONCE AGAIN
ISRAEL'S TOTAL DISREGARD FOR THE PRINCIPLES OF
SOVEREIGNTY AND TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY OF STATES AND
ITS LACK OF RESPECT FOR AFRICAN AND ARAB LIVES.
"THIS WAS, HOWEVER, NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT ISRAEL
HAD VIOLATED, WITH TOTAL IMPUNITY, THE CHARTER OF
THE UNITED NATIONS AND HAD LAUNCHED UNPROVOKED AGGRESSION
AGAINST A SOVEREIGN STATE.  THE LAST TWENTY-EIGHT
YEARS ABOUND WITH INNUMERABLE ACTS OF AGGRESSION
COMMITTED BY ISRAEL IN FURTHERANCE OF ITS EXPANSIONIST
DESIGNS.  THE LATEST ACT OF ISRAELI AGGRESSION WAS
SPECIALLY SHOCKING SINCE PRESIDENT IDI AMIN HAD
PERSONALLY BEEN NEGOTIATING THE RELEASE OF THE
HOSTAGES WITH THE HIJACKERS AND HAD ALREADY SUCCEEDED
IN SECURING THE RELEASE OF OVER 150 PERSONS."
4.  IN FURTHER DISCUSSION, NAIK REITERATED THAT GOP
DRAWS A DISTINCTION BETWEEN HIJACKINGS BY INDIVIDUAL
TERRORISTS, WHICH IT CONDEMNS, AND THOSE CARRIED OUT BY
RECOGNIZED LIBERATION ORGANIZATIONS IN PURSUANCE OF THEIR
EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE SELF-DETERMINATION.  PAKISTAN, HE
SAID, WOULD SUPPORT ANY MEASURES AT THE UN TO PROTEST
THE FIRST CATEGORY OF HIJACKINGS.  AS FOR THE SECOND,
HE SAID THAT ACTION MUST BE TAKEN TO REMOVE THE
FUNDAMENTAL REASONS WHY THEY TAKE PLACE.  ASKED IN
WHICH CATEGORY HE THOUGHT THE LATEST HIJACKING FELL,
NAIK REPLIED THAT THE ISRAELI ACTION HAD GIVEN A NEW
COMPLEXION TO THE AFFAIR.
5.  NAIK STOUTLY DEFENDED IDI AMIN'S ROLE CLAIMING THAT
THE UGANDAN PRESIDENT HAD BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR RELEASE
OF MANY HOSTAGES AND THAT HE WAS MAKING FURTHER PROGRESS WHEN
ISRAELIS INTERVENED.  CITING HIS OWN ROLE IN THE

HAD REPORTEDLY MOUNTED TOOK MUCH TIME AND PATIENCE.
THE ISRAELIS HAD NO JUSTIFICATION WHATEVER FOR ACTING
AS THEY DID AND THEIR ACTION MIGHT WELL HAVE ADVERSE
REPERCUSSIONS ON THEM.
COMMENT:  NAIK'S REACTION COMES AS NO SURPRISE.  AS

SEEKING TO ASSOCIATE ITSELF WITH THIRD WORLD CAUSES,

1.  SWEDISH FOREIGN MINISTER SVEN ANDERSSON HAS
RELEASED A STATEMENT EXPRESSING THE SWEDISH GOVERNMENT'S
RELIEF AT THE RESCUE OF THE HOSTAGES FROM ENTEBBE
AIRPORT. UNOFFICIAL TRANSLATION FOLLOWS:
2.  "THE SWEDISH GOVERNMENT HAS WITH GREAT RELIEF
RECEIVED THE INFORMATION THAT ALMOST ALL THOSE WHO WERE
TAKEN HOSTAGE - AMONG THEM THE SWEDISH CITIZEN ANN-CARINA
FRANKING - HAVE ESCAPED UNHARMED FROM THE HIJACKING DRAMA
IN UGANDA. AT THE SAME TIME THE GOVERNMENT WISHES TO
EXPRESS ITS DEEP SYMPATHY WITH THE PERSONS FROM SEVERAL
COUNTRIES WHO HAVE LOST A CLOSE RELATIVE. THE
GOVERNMENT HAS REPEATEDLY STRONGLY CONDEMNED THE TAKING
OF HOSTAGES AND OTHER TYPES OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.
IT IS ENTIRELY UNACCEPTABLE THAT IRRESPONSIBLE AND
CRIMINAL GROUPS ATTACK PRIVATE CITIZENS THIS WAY. THIS
HIJACKING DRAMA CAUSES THE SWEDISH GOVERNMENT TO
SHARPLY REPEAT THIS VIEWPOINT. HOWEVER, THIS DOES
NOT MEAN THAT WE TAKE A STAND ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW
ASPECTS OF WHAT JUST HAPPENED. THE GOVERNMENT WILL
HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT ITS VIEWS ON THIS AT THE
EXPECTED DEBATE IN THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL."

THAT FACT HE HAD REQUESTED INFORMATION ON UGANDA'S ROLE
FROM USG NOT RPT NOT LEAK OUT.  WE ASSURED HIM THAT IT
WOULD NOT FROM OUR SIDE.

CAUSE CONFLICT WITHIN GOS BETWEEN THOSE OFFICIALS MOST
CONCERNED ABOUT TERRORISM AND THOSE WHOSE CHIEF
INTEREST LIES IN PRESERVING GOOD RELATIONS WITH ARAB

LEIFLAND HAS MADE IT CLEAR THAT HE BELIEVES MOST
IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION IS THAT HOSTAGES ESCAPED
UNHARMED, AND STATEMENT ON OPERATION ISSUED BY SWEDISH
GOVERNMENT (OF WHICH LEIFLAND WAS PRINCIPLE AUTHOR)
REFLECTED THIS VIEW (REF C).  HOWEVER, IT IS
UNCERTAIN WHETHER HIS VIEWS WILL PREVAIL WITHIN GOS
