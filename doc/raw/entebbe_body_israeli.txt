C. PARIS 19328, D. PARIS 19871
1. THE FOLLOWING IS A COMPOSITE REPORT ON SOME OF THE
ASPECTS OF THE RECENT HIJACKING OF THE AIR FRANCE
AIRBUS BASED ON CONVERSATIONS WITH A NUMBER OF THE
AMERICANS WHO WERE RELEASED.  THEIR ACCOUNTS WERE
GENERALLY CONGRUENT AND COINCIDE WITH THE REPORTS FROM
THE GERMAN EMBASSY IN KAMPALA (REF. A).  SINCE MANY
ASPECTS ARE A MATTER OF IMPRESSION RATHER THAN FIRM
OBSERVATION, THERE ARE SOME DIFFERENCES IN THE
ACCOUNTS, WHICH WE NOTE.  WE GO OVER SOME OF THE SAME
GROUND COVERED IN THE ACCOUNTS IN REFS B, C AND D.
THERE IS SOME CONFUSION OVER NOMENCLATURE FOR THE
THREE EIEMENTS INVOLVED IN THE HIJACKING.  ALL THE
AMERICANS REFERRED TO MEMBERS OF ALL THREE AS PLO
PRESUMABLY SINCE ENGLISH SPEAKING GERMANS WITH WHOM
THEY HAD MOST CONTACT SAID THEY WORKED FOR PLO.  BUT
THE ARABS ON THE GROUND WHO WERE APPARENTLY IN CHARGE
OF THE WHOLE CHE GUEVARA COMMANDO GROUP MADE THE
DISTINCTION AND SPECIFIED THEY WORKED FOR PFLP AND NOT
PLO.  GERMANS PERHAPS DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE
DISTINCTION.
2. RETAINED AMERICANS.  SOME OF THE AMERICANS HAD
IDENTIFIED GEORGE AND RENE KARFUNKEL AS AMERICANS AND
WERE AWARE THAT THEY HAD ONLY AMERICAN PASSPORTS AND
HAD BEEN IN ISRAEL ONLY BRIEFLY.  NO ONE HAD A
SATISFACTORY EXPLANATION OF WHY THE KARFUNKELS HAD NOT
BEEN RELEASED WITH THE OTHER AMERICANS.  THE KARFUNKELS
APPEARED VERY ORTHODOX, ATE ONLY KOSHER FOOD AND WERE
SEATED WITH THE ISRAELIS ABOARD THE PLANE AND REMAINED
WITH THEM EVEN ON THE GROUND BECAUSE THE COMMANDOS
PERMITTED THEM TO PREPARE KOSHER FOOD.  HOWEVER, THE
COMMANDOS GENERALLY WORKED FROM THE DOCUMENTS WHICH THEY
HAD COLLECTED AND THE PRINTED CARDS (IN ARABIC) WHICH
THEY HAD EACH PASSENGER FILL OUT.  THE COMMANDOS WERE
THEREFORE WELL AWARE THAT THE KARFUNKELS HAD AMERICAN
PASSPORTS ONLY.  ONE AMERICAN SUGGESTED THAT THEIR
FLAUNTING OF THEIR JEWISHNESS MIGHT HAVE ALIENATED SOME
OF THE ARABS IN THE COMMANDOS.  ON THE OTHER HAND,
OTHERS THOUGHT THEIR RETENTION MIGHT HAVE BEEN JUST AN
OVERSIGHT.  AS FOR JANET ALMOG, NONE OF THE AMERICANS
WE HAVE QUESTIONED WERE AWARE OF HER PRESENCE.  SHE WAS
PROBABLY RETAINED ON THE BASIS OF HER ISRAELI
DOCUMENTATION (AS WERE THE FRENCH/ISRAELI DUAL
NATIONALS) IN ADDITION TO HER BEING SEATED WITH THE
ISRAELIS.  THE AMERICANS NOTED THAT THE DUAL NATIONALS
HAD MADE NO ATTEMPTS TO DESTROY OR DISCARD THE EVIDENCE
OF THEIR ISRAELI CITIZENSHIP ALTHOUGH OTHERS HAD
DESTROYED SOME COMPROMISING DOCUMENTATION SUCH AS PRESS
CARDS.  HIJACKERS WHILE STILL ON PLANE WARNED THAT
QTE ANYONE WHO DESTROYED IDENTITY DOCUMENTS WOULD BE
SEVERELY PUNISHED END QTE.
3. ROLE OF THE HIJACKERS.  THE AMERICANS INVARIABLY
WERE OF THE IMPRESSION THAT THERE WERE TWO GERMANS
AND TWO RATHER INEXPERIENCED YOUNG ARABS WHO HAD TAKEN
OVER THE PLANE SHORTLY AFTER TAKEOFF FROM ATHENS.  THE
GERMAN MAN, BASIL CODE NAME KUBESKY - AFTER GERMAN
TERRORIST KILLED 1973, WAS THE OBVIOUS LEADER OF THE
HIJACK GROUP ALTHOUGH THE WOMAN WAS OFTEN THE MOST
VIRULENT.  WE REFER TO THE WOMAN AS QTE GERMAN END QTE
BECAUSE THE AMERICANS ALL DID.  SHE SPEAKS ENGLISH WITH
A DECIDED GERMAN ACCENT.  SOME SOURCES, HOWEVER, HAVE

BEEN ABLE TO IDENTIFY HER AS TURKISH TERRORIST, BERGAS
ETURK (PARIS 19514).  BASIL WAS OBVIOUSLY MORE
TECHNICALLY EXPERIENCED THAN THE YOUNG ARABS AND HELPED
THEM ASSEMBLE THE BOMBS WITH WHICH THEY THREATENED TO
BIOW UP THE AIRCRAFT.  SOME AMERICANS CONSIDERED THE
GERMANS TO BE SINCERE REVOLUTIONARIES WHO WERE NOT
WORKING MERELY FOR THE ACCOUNT OF THE PFLP OR PLO, BUT
ALSO TO FREE THEIR COLLEAGUES IMPRISONED IN GERMANY
WHOM THEY APPEARED TO KNOW PERSONALLY.  OTHERS THOUGHT
THAT THEY MIGHT BE BASICALLY MERCENARIES AND THAT THE
REAL LEADERS OF THE PFLP OR PLO WOULD NOT PUSH FOR THE
RELEASE OF THEIR GERMAN FRIENDS.  ON THE GROUND, THE
FOUR PLO WHO MOVED IN WHEN THEY REACHED ENTEBBE ASSUMED
PRINCIPAL COMMAND, BUT SOME CONSIDERED THAT QTE BASIL
END QTE CONTINUED TO BE QTE GENERAL MANAGER END QTE
OF THE GROUP AND WAS ABLE TO MAKE A MAJOR INPUT INTO
THE DECISIONS AS TO WHO SHOULD BE RELEASED, FOR EXAMPLE.
AT ALL EVENTS, THE GERMANS WERE VERY VOLUBLE IN THEIR
DISCUSSION OF THE NECESSITY OF WORLD REVOLUTION,
OVERTURNING WORLD IMPERIALISM AND CAPITALISM, AND PUT
ON A GOOD SHOW IN SUPPORT OF THE IDEOLOGICAL BASIS FOR
THEIR JOINING WITH THE OPPRESSED PALESTINIAN PEOPLE.
4. ROLE OF THE FOUR ARAB LEADERS IN UGANDA:  THE
PASSENGERS FOUND THE FOUR ARAB FIGURES WHO JOINED THE
GROUP WHEN IT LANDED IN ENTEBBE TO BE MORE
AUTHORITATIVE AND MUCH TOUGHER THAN THE FOUR HIJACKERS.
ALSO, WHILE THE GERMANS IN LAR FREQUENTLY
EMPHASIZED THAT THEY WERE NOT RACIST (I.E. ANTI-JEW),
THEY WERE ANTI-ZIONIST.  THE FOUR ARAB FIGURES WERE
HOWEVER, CLEARLY ANTI-JEW AND TOOK A CERTAIN SADISTIC
PLEASURE IN FORCING THE OLD JEWISH PASSENGERS TO PLEAD
TO BE AMONG THOSE SENT TO FRANCE.  TWO OF THIS GROUP
WERE TALL, ONE VERY HEAVY (OVER 200 POUNDS) AND WORE
BLACK MOUSTACHES.  A SHORT HEAVY-SET MAN WITH A COMICAL
FACE, AS THOUGH HE WERE WEARING THE STEREOTYPED BIG
NOSE/HORNRIMMED GLASSES MASK, APPEARED TO BE THE MOST
INFLUENTIAL.  ALTHOUGH MOST AMERICANS REFERRED TO THEM
AS ARABS, ONE COMMENTED THAT SHE HAD GATHERED HE WAS
A PERUVIAN -- AND HE SPOKE SPANISH AS WELL AS
ENGLISH AND FRENCH.  ANOTHER AMERICAN SAID HE HAD KNOWN
LATIN AMERICANS AND WAS SURE HE WAS MORE LIKELY A
LEBANESE.  ENGLISH WAS THE LANGUAGE USED BETWEEN THE
ARABS AND THE GERMANS, AND AFTER THE ARRIVAL IN UGANDA,
MOST CONVERSATIONS AMONG THE COMMANDO MEMBERS WERE
CONDUCTED OUTSIDE THE HEARING  OF THE PASSENGERS.
COMMANDOS SET UP AN QTE OFFICE END QTE IN THE CORNER
OF THE ROOM WHERE THEY DISCUSSED MATTERS.  THE
FOUR HIJACKERS WERE NOT ALWAYS INVITED TO THESE MEETINGS
ALTHOUGH ONLY QTE BASIL END QTE APPARENTLY DID NOT
SPEAK ARABIC.  GESTURES WERE THE PRINCIPAL MEANS OF
COMMUNICATION WHEN WITH THE PRISONERS.  THESE FOUR ARABS
APPEARED TO BE KNOWN BY SIGHT (PERHAPS THROUGH PHOTO-
GRAPHS) TO THE TWO GERMANS WHO VISIBLY SHOWED THEIR
RELIEF WHEN THEY APPROACHED THE PLANE AN HOUR OR MORE
AFTER IT LANDED.  IT WAS NOT CLEAR, HOWEVER, WHETHER
THEY WERE PFLP REPS WHO WERE STATIONED IN UGANDA OR HAD
COME IN FOR THE OCCASION.  FOUR ARABS NEVER SEEMED TAKE
TWO YOUNG SELF-PROFESSED PALESTINIANS INTO THEIR
CONFIDENCE.
5. ROLE OF AMIN.  WITHOUT EXCEPTION THE AMERICANS FOUND
AMIN REPELLENT AND DUPLICITOUS IN HIS TREATMENT OF THE
PRISONERS.  HE CLAIMED CREDIT FOR EVERYTHING WHICH
BENEFITTED THE PRISONERS FROM THE FOOD AND MATTRESSES
WHICH WERE SUPPLIED TO THE MORE CONCILIATORY ACTIONS OF
THE HIJACKERS.  THE PLO FIGURES ALSO WENT OUT OF THEIR
WAY TO GIVE CREDIT TO AMIN, WHAT APPEARED TO BE PART OF
THEIR EFFORT TO MAINTAIN HIS SUPPORT.  ALL AGREED THAT
AMIN HAD PROBABLY LEARNED THAT UGANDA WAS THE PLANE'S
DESTINATION BEFORE IT LANDED, AND SOME SPECULATED THAT
HE HAD BEEN AWARE OF THE PLOT BEFORE THE HIJACKING.
BASIS SAID WHEN THEY LEFT LIBYA FOR UGANDA THAT PERHAPS
AMIN WOULD BE AT THE AIRPORT WAITING FOR THEM.  THE
PLANE TAXIED AROUND THE FIELD FOR ABOUT AN HOUR BEFORE
BASIL GOT OFF THE PLANE AND MADE JOYFUL CONTACT WITH THE
FOUR WAITING ARAB FIGURES, BUT SOME AMERICANS THOUGHT
THAT THE DELAY COULD HAVE BEEN BECAUSE THEY WERE
EXPECTED AT KAMPALA AIRPORT OR THAT THERE HAD BEEN SOME
DELAY IN GETTING TOGETHER THE ARAB FIGURES AND THE
UGANDAN TROOPS.  IT WAS CLEAR THAT AMIN GAVE SUPPORT TO
THE COMMANDOS SINCE THEY ACQUIRED MORE AND MORE LETHAL
WEAPONS AFTER ARRIVAL AND THE UGANDAN TROOPS WERE

C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 03 OF 04 PARIS 19568
CLEARLY THERE AS A BACK-UP FORCE NOT JUST QTE
IMPRISONING END QTE COMMANDOS BUT ALSO HELPING IMPRISON
PASSENGERS.  GIVEN THE PHYSICAL SET-UP, THE GREAT
NUMBER OF UGANDANS, AND THEIR CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE
PLO, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE EASY, MOST THOUGHT,
FOR THE UGANDANS TO HAVE DISARMED OR KILLED THE
COMMANDOS HAD THEY WISHED.  IN FACT, THE PASSENGERS
BEGAN TO FEAR THE UGANDANS EVEN MORE THAN THE FOUR
ARABS WHO HAD TAKEN OVER ON ARRIVAL, JUST AS THEY
INITIALLY HAD FEARED THE FOUR ARABS MORE THAN THE
ORIGINAL HIJACKERS.
6.  AMIN HIMSELF MADE NO BONES ABOUT HIS SYMPATHY FOR THE
THE AIMS OF THE COMMANDOS.  HE SAID THAT HE WAS HAPPY
TO HELP THE COMMANDOS SINCE HE SHARED THEIR OPINIONS.
HE TOLD THE PASSENGERS THAT IF THEIR GOVERNMENTS WISHED
TO SEE THEM ALIVE, THEY MUST COOPERATE IN MEETING THE
JUST DEMANDS OF THE HIJACKERS.
7.  SOME OF THE AMERICANS THOUGHT THAT AMIN HOPED
TO GET CREDIT FOR THE HUMANE TREATMENT OF THE
PASSENGERS AND THEIR RELEASE AND TO GET THE GRATITUDE
OF THE EXTREMIST ARABS BECAUSE OF HIS MAKING POSSIBLE
THE DETENTION OF THE PASSENGERS WITH NO RISK TO THE
HIJACKERS AND FACILITATING THE RELEASE OF TERRORISTS.
SOME CYNICALLY NOTED THAT UGANDA WAS MAKING A GREAT
DEAL OF MONEY OUT OF THE HIJACKING, BOTH FROM AIR
FRANCE PAYMENTS AND THE INDIVIDUAL EXPENDITURES BY THE
PASSENGERS -- $1 FOR TOILET PAPER, FOR EXAMPLE.
8. POSSIBLE ROLE OF SOME PASSENGERS.  SEVERAL AMERICANS
WERE SUSPICIOUS OF ONE OF THE JORDANIAN (SALMY) AND
EGYPTIAN PASSENGERS, BUT NOT OF THE MORROCAN.  SOME
THOUGH THAT SALMY AND THEEGYPTIAN BOTH WERE WORKING
WITH THE HIJACKERS AT LEAST AFTER THE EVENT, AND THAT
SALMY IN PARTICULAR SEEMED TO BE THE HIJACKERS SPY
AMONG THE PASSENGERS.  SOME EVEN THOUGHT THAT THE
JORDANIAN MIGHT HAVE HELPED THE HIJACKERS GET THEIR
ARMS AND EXPLOSIVES ON BOARD.  ONE AMERICAN BELIEVED
THAT ONE OF THE CANADIAN PASSENGERS, MIRIAM FIELD, HAD
HELPED BRING ARMS ABOARD IN HER HEAVY HANDBAG AND HAD
PASSED THEM TO THE GERMAN WOMAN WHEN SHE WENT TO THE
LADIES' ROOM ON THE WEAK EXCUSE OF WISHING TO FRESHEN
HER MAKEUP IMMEDIATELY AFTER TAKE OFF RATHER THAN
IMMEDIATELY BEFORE LANDING IN ORDER TO BE AT HER BEST
FOR PARIS.  CANADIAN EMBASSY OFFICIALS FOUND THAT
FIELD LEFT THE AIRPORT QUICKLY (WITH AN AMERICAN)
WITHOUT CHECKING IN WITH THEM AND SHE HAS NOT BEEN
STAYING AT THE HOTEL WHERE RESERVATIONS HAD BEEN MADE.
SINCE SHE WOULD BE WITHOUT DOCUMENTATION IF SHE HAD
BEEN TREATED LIKE THE OTHER PASSENGERS, CANADIANS ARE
SURPRISED THAT SHE HAS NOT BEEN IN CONTACT WITH THEM.
WE REPORT THE ABOVE AS MERELY THE IMPRESSIONS OF SOME
OF THE PASSENGERS, SPECULATION INDUCED BY THEIR
SURPRISE THAT EVEN THE LAX SECURITY AT THE ATHENS
AIRPORT HAD PERMITTED THE INTRODUCTION OF SUBSTANTIAL
ARMS.
9.  INTENTIONS OF THE HIJACKERS.  THE AMERICANS
GENERALLY THOUGHT THE HIJACKERS CONSIDERED THE MOST
IMPORTANT PUBLICITY WAS AT LEAST CONSIDERABLE IF NOT
TOTAL SUCCESS IN OBTAINING THE RELEASE OF PRISONERS
IN ISRAEL, FRANCE AND GERMANY, AT LEAST. THEY
THOUGHT THAT COMMANDOS DID NOT INTEND A GENERAL KILLING
OF THE ISRAELIS OR OF THE FRENCH YOUNG PASSENGERS AND
CREW, BUT THAT THEY MIGHT START BY SHOOTING ONE OR TWO
ISRAELIS FIRST TO EMPHASIZE THE SERIOUSNESS OF THEIR
DEMANDS.  THE ARABS SEEMED NOW RATHER SURE OF THEMSELVES
SINCE THEY NOW APPEARED CONVINCED OF COMPLETE BACKING
FROM AMIN.  (THE GERMANS, HOWEVER, HAD APPARENTLY
COMPLETELY DISLIKED AND DISTRUSTED AMIN PERHAPS
BECAUSE HE IS NOT AN INTELLECTUAL RATHER THAN OUT OF
REAL FEAR HE MIGHT TURN ON THEM.)  HE AMERICANS
THOUGHT THAT THE COMMANDOS' OPTIMISM WAS JUSTIFIED
SINCE THEY HELD ALL THE CARDS AND EVENTUALLY EVEN
ISRAEL WOULD BE FORCED TO YIELD, IN PART BECAUSE OF
DEMANDS FROM MANY RELATIVES OF THE ISRAELI CAPTIVES.
10. THE AMERICANS AT FIRST WERE SURPRISED AT THE
ANIMOSITY SHOWN TOWARD THE FRENCH GIVEN THE RATHER
PRO-ARAB GOF POLICY, BUT THE GERMANS TOLD THEM THAT NOT
ONLY HAD FRANCE HELPED ISRAEL MATERIALLY (NUCLEAR

ENERGY PLANT, MIRAGES, ETC.) BUT ALSO THE FRENCH
GOVERNMENT HAD PERMITTED ISRAELI AGENTS TO KILL 50 OF
THE PALESTINIAN AGENTS IN FRANCE WITHOUT ANY EFFORT BY
THE GOF TO FIND AND PROSECUTE THE ASSASSINS.  HENCE
THE DECISION TO ATTACK A FRENCH PLANE, TO HOLD
PRISONER THE FRENCH CREW AND SOME YOUNG FRENCH
PASSENGERS, AND TO MAKE HEAVY DEMANDS ON THE FRENCH
GOVERNMENT CONCERNING RELEASE OF PRISONERS.
11. SITUATION OF ISRAELI PRISONERS.  THE AMERICANS
SAID THAT THE ISRAELIS WERE WELL ORGANIZED, DISCIPLINED,
COHESIVE, BUT PASSIVE.  ALTHOUGH THE FRENCH APPLAUDED
EACH TIME AMIN MADE A THEATRICAL ENTRANCE IN A
DIFFERENT COSTUME, THE ISREALIS RESPONDED WITH SILENT
DEFIANCE.  THEY APPARENTLY HAVE NEVER CONSIDERED THE
POSSIBILITY OF RESISTANCE, NO DOUBT IN PART BECAUSE
SO MANY OF THEM ARE VERY OLD.  ONCE THEY WERE IN UGANDA
ALL THOUGHT OF RESISTANCE WAS UNREALISTIC SINCE THEY
ARE SURROUNDED BY HUNDREDS OF AMIN'S PARATROOPERS.
AMIN HAD SAID THAT IF THERE WERE AN ASSAULT FROM
OUTSIDE OR AN UPRISING WITHIN THE BUILDING, THE WHOLE
BUILDING WOULD BE BLOWN UP.  THE AMERICANS BELIEVE
THAT THIS IS NOT TRUE, AND THAT BOXES SOME THOUGHT
MIGHT BE FILLED WITH DYNAMITE WERE REALLY DESIGNED
JUST TO BLOCK OFF A DOOR.  IN ANY CASE, THE ISRAELIS
KNOW THAT THEIR CHANCES OF RESCUE OR ESCAPE ARE NIL.
THE DISTRESS HAS INCREASED AS THEY HAVE SEEN TWO
PLANELOADS OF OTHER PASSENGERS LEAVE, BUT THEY HAVE
REMAINED STOIC.  A FEW MORE DAYS UNDER THESE
CIRCUMSTANCES COULD CAUSE SOME OF THE OLD AND INFIRM
TO BREAK -- JUST AS TWO OLD FRENCH WOMEN BROKE THE
NIGHT OF THEIR ARRIVAL IN UGANDA.
12. THE GERMANS HERE HAVE ALREADY EXPRESSED AN
INTEREST IN OUR REPORTS OF THE OBSERVATIONS AND
OPINIONS OF THE AMERICAN PASSENGERS.  WE SUGGEST THE
DEPARTMENT DECIDE WHETHER THE ABOVE SHOULD BE
FURNISHED WHOLE OR IN PART TO CERTAIN FRIENDLY
GOVERNMENTS.

1. AT A PRESS CONFERENCE ON JULY 4, FEDERAL COUNCILOR
KURT FURGLER (CHIEF OF JUSTICE AND POLICE MINISTRY) ON
BEHALF OF SWISS GOVT EXPRESSED RELIEF OVER THE
FREEING OF THE HOSTAGES. FURGLER ALSO NOTED THAT KAMPALA
WILL NOT BE THE END OF THE STORY; THE PALESTINE PROBLEM
REMAINS.
2. IN A REVIEW OF LAST WEEK'S EVENTS, FURGLER STRESSED
THE CLOSE COORDINATION WITH PARIS, BONN AND TEL AVIV.
FURGLER MENTIONED THAT THE GOS ATTEMPTED ON JULY 1-2, THROUGH
THE ZAIRIAN AMBASSADOR IN BERN, TO GET PRESIDENT MOBUTO TO
INTERVENE IN UGANDA IN EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE A BLOODLESS
SOLUTION. AS PRESSURE FROM KAMPALA MOUNTED, THE FEDERAL
COUNCIL MET SEVERAL TIMES ON JULY 3. IN THE EVENING,
THE FEDERAL COUNCIL FINALLY DECIDED NOT TO RELEASE
PETRA KRAUSE. IN A TELEGRAM TO THE PFLP THROUGH THE
FRENCH GOVT THE FEDERAL COUNCIL STATED THAT THERE
WAS NO PALESTINIAN FREEDOM FIGHTER IN SWISS JAILS. FURGLER
STRESSED THE DECISION CAME BEFORE GOS HAD KNOWLEDGE OF THE
ISRAELI COMMANDO ACTION.
3. SWISS REACTED POSITIVELY TO THE ISREALI LIBERATION OF
HOSTAGES. ISREALI EMBASSY HAS BEEN SWAMPED WITH CONGRATULATORY
CALLS. EDITORIAL COMMENTS HAVE STRONGLY ENDORSED ISRAELI
ACTION; NEUE ZURCHER ZEITUNG EDITORIAL NOTED THAT " THE
PRESENT MASTER OF UGANDA PLACES HIMSELF ABOVE ALL LAW;
HE MORE OR LESS COOPERATED WITH INTERNATIONAL CRIMINALS IN
THE PRESENT CASE. THE DEFENSE OF THE LAW THROUGHOUT THE
WORLD IS SERVED MORE IF A SMALL FELLOW IN AN EMERGENCY
EXCEEDS MISUSED RULES OF THE GAME THROUGH A BRAVE ACT THAN
IF GREAT NATIONS ALLOW THEMSELVES TO BE BLACKMAILED BY
CRIMINAL FREEBOOTERS AND POLITICAL AMOK RUNNERS." ONLY
SOUR EDITORIAL NOTE WAS STRUCK IN JOURNAL DE GENEVE WHICH
SAID THAT REACTION WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT HAD ISRAELI
ACTION TAKEN PLACE IN SWITZERLAND (IGNORING THAT CIRCUMSTANCES
THEN WOULD HAVE BEEN GREATLY DIFFERENT).

C) STATE 167345
1.  SUMMARY:  I GAVE FONMIN WILLS MUCH OF INFOR-
MATION IN REF C, BUT GOT REACTION THAT AMIN'S COOPERATION WITH
TERRORISTS WAS LARGELY IMMATERIAL SINCE WILLS AND CABINET FELT
ISRAEL WOULD HAVE STAGED OPERATION IN ANY EVENT.  WILLS AND GOG
APPARENTLY HAVE MOVED TOWARD POSTION OF RACIALLY-BASED HOSTILITY
TO ISRAEL, THOUGH WILLS SAID HE FAVORS POSTPONING RESOLUTION
CERTAIN TO BE VETOED BY WESTERN POWERS.  ACCORDING WILLS, GUYANA
CABINET FEELS INTERVENTION IN UGANDA BY ISRAEL MUST SOMEHOW
BE PUBLICLY CONDEMNED BY INTERNATIONAL COMMUNIST TO PREVENT
PRECEDENT WHICH COULD BE USED BY BRAZILIANS OR OTHERS TO INTERVENE
MILITARILY IN GUYANA.  END SUMMARY.
2.  I SAW FONMIN WILLS AGAIN NOON JULY 7 ON THIS MATTER.  I
HANDED HIM PAPER WITH TEXT OF PARAS 9 THROUGH 15, REF C, MODIFIED
ONLY TO REMOVE REFERENCE TO ISRAEL EMBASSY AS SOURCE OF ACCOUNTS.
I ALSO WENT OVER SOME OF CLASSIFIED PORTIONS OF TEXT OF REF C
ORALLY.
3.  WILLS SAID THAT HE, MOST MEMBERS OF CABINET AND HE UNDERSTANDS
MOST AFRICAN LEADERS VIEW THE ALLEGED COOPERATION OF AMIN WITH
THE TERRORISTS AS BASICALLY IMMATERIAL.  WILLS SAID HE FELT THE
ISRAELIS WOULD HAVE CARRIED OUT THE OPERATION EVEN IF AMIN HAD
SIMPLY SURROUNDED THE PLANE WITH TROOPS AND OFFERED
THE TERRORISTS NO ENCOURAGEMENT, SINCE THEIR BASIC PURPOSE WAS TO
DRAMATICALLY SQUASH THE TERRORISTS.  WILLS CONTINUED THAT THE ISSUE
HAS NOW BECOME IRRETRIEVABLY TIED UP WITH BLACK/WHITE RACIAL
CONFLICT IN AFRICA.  HE EXPLAINED THAT THE ESSENTIAL REASON WHY MANY
AFRICAN STATES REACTED FAVORABLY TO THE LARGELY BLACK CUBAN INTER-
VENTION IN ANGOLA AGAINST THE WHITE SOUTH AFRICANS WAS THAT IT
DESTROYED THE MYTH OF WHITE INVINCIBILITY WHICH HAD BEEN ESTA-
BLISHED BY THE MERCENARIES IN THE CONGO.  WITH THIS OPERATION,
ACCORDING TO WILLS, THAT MYTH HAS BEEN RE-ESTABLISHED.
4.  WILLS SAID CABINET YESTERDAY HAD REACTED WITH VEHEMENCE
AGAINST ISRAELI OPERATION IN UGANDA, NOTING THAT SOME "WILD MEN"
HAD WANTED GUYANA TO SPONSOR RESOLUTION EXPELLING ISRAEL FROM
U.N.  WILLS CLAIMED IT HAD TAKEN HIM BETTER PART OF TWO HOURS
TO INDUCE MORE REALISTIC REACTION TO SITUATION.  WILLS SAID, HOW-
EVER, THAT HE AGREED ISRAEL ACTION WAS "DISASTEROUS" TO ISRAEL'S
POSITION IN THIRD WORLD.
5.  WILLS SAID THAT GUYANA WILL HAVE TO SUPPORT CONDEMNATION OF
ISRAEL IF IT COME TO A VOTE IN THE S.C.  WILLS SAID THIS NECESSITY
IS NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF SOLIDARITY WITH OAU STATES, BUT LARGELY
BECAUSE OF LOCAL SITUATION WHEREBY ISRAELI INTERVENTION COULD BE
USED AS PRECEDENT BY BRAZIL FOR INTERVENTION IN GUYANA. HE
INDICATED HE IS IN TWICE DAILY TELEPHONE CONTACT WITH RASHLEIGH
JACKSON AND HAS INSTRUCTED JACKSON TO KEEP HIM INFORMED AND SEEK
INSTRUCTIONS AT EVERY STAGE OF WAY.  WILLS SAID HE HOPES TO AVOID
SITUATION LAST FALL WHEN JACKSON CAST GUYANA'S VOTE IN FAVOR OF
ZIONISM IS RACISM ISSUE WITHOUT ADEQUATE CONSULTATION WITH WILLS.
6.  I TOLD WILLS WHETHER THE ISRAELI OPERATION WAS JUSTIFIED OR NOT
IT WAS OBVIOUSLY A FAIT ACCOMPLI AND THE QUESTION WAS NOW HOW
SHOULD THE S.C. AND SPECIFICALLY GUYANA AND THE U.S. REACT.  WILLS
SAID HE FELT SOME SPECIFIC UNILATERAL ACTS BY ISRAEL WERE NOW
ESSENTIAL TO AVERT AN EXTREMELY HOSTILE RESOLUTION WHICH HE
RECOGNIZED WOULD INEVITABLY BE VETOED BY U.S. AND POSSIBLY FRANCE
AND U.K.  HE SAID HE WOULD RECOMMEND AN ISRAELI STATEMENT REGRETTING
THE LOSS OF UGANDAN LIVES IN THE OPERATION AND OFFERING COMPEN-
SATION FOR THE FAMILIES OF THE SOLDIERS KILLED.  HE SAID EVEN
WITH SUCH A STATEMENT, GUYANA AND MOST OF THE AFRICAN COUNTRIES
STILL MUST GET SOMETHING ON THE RECORD INDICATING PUBLICLY THAT
THEY DO NOT CONDONE INTERVENTION.  HE FELT SUCH A RESOLUTION
COULD ALSO SPECIFY THAT TERRORISM IS NOT CONDONED AND THAT NO
NATION SHOULD COOPERATE WITH TERRORISTS BUT THAT ANY RESOLUTION
WHICH GUYANA AND THE AFRICAN STATES SUPPORTED MUST BE
CLEARLY MORE AIMED AT ISRAEL THAN AT UGANDA.
7.  I TOLD WILLS I WOULD PASS HIS OBSERVATIONS ON TO WASHINGTON.
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, WIGH GUYANA LIKELY TO BE HOSTILE TO OUR
PROPOSED ANTI-TERRORIST RESOLUTION, I DID NOT RPT NOT TELL WILLS
THAT WE PLAN TO TAKE SUCH PRE-EMPTORY ACTION NOR DID I SOLICIT
GUYANA'S SUPPORT FOR SUCH A RESOLUTION

1.  SUMMARY.  IN MEETING RELATING TO ISRAEL'S ACTION IN
UGANDA, GOR SPOKESMAN APPRECIATED U.S.' POSITION AGAINST
TERRORISM AND IN FAVOR OF BALANCE, BUT MAINTAINED THAT
ISRAEL'S VIOLATION OF UGANDA'S TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY WAS
PRIMARY ISSUE AND INTIMATED GOR SUPPORT FOR ANTI-ISRAELI
RESOLUTION IN UNSC.  END SUMMARY.
2.  AS PER REFTEL A, EMBASSY POLITICAL COUNSELOR
INFORMED MFA JURIDICAL DIRECTORATE COUNSELOR GHEORGHE
SAULESCU OF USG INTENTION TO OPPOSE ONE-SIDED UGANDA-
OR OAU-SPONSORED RESOLUTION IN UNSC CONDEMNING ISRAEL AND/OR
KENYA REGARDING ISRAELI RESCUE OPERATION.  GOR WAS INFORMED
THAT USG WOULD SPONSOR BALANCED RESOLUTION CONDEMNING
"ALL STATES WHICH FAILED TO ACT VIGOROUSLY AGAINST
TERRORIST ACTS."
3.  SAULESCU SAID THAT GOR CONDEMNS ANY ATTACK BY ONE
STATE AGAINST TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY OF ANOTHER STATE,
AND SUPPORTS ABSOLUTELY NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY AND
INDEPENDENCE "WITHOUT REGARD TO THE PRETEXTS" OF THE
ATTACKING STATE.  USG POSITION WITH REGARD TO INTER-
NATIONAL LAW AND TREATIES ON TERRORISM WERE RECOGNIZED,
AND USG WAS WELL AWARE OF ROMANIAN VIEW THAT TERRORISM
IS "NEGATIVE ACT AGAINST INTERNATIONAL EXISTENCE."
HOWEVER, GOR COULD FIND NO EXCUSE OR JUSTIFICATION FOR
ISRAEL'S "DANGEROUS" ACTION.
4.  ASKED TO WHAT EXTENT GOR COULD SUPPORT GENERAL
RESOLUTION AGAINST TERRORISM CONSISTENT WITH 1972 TERRORISM
CONVENTION, SAULESCU STATED THAT QUESTIONS OF VIOLATION OF
SOVEREIGNTY AND TERRORISM WERE TWO SEPARATE PROBLEMS. AND
THAT UN ALREADY HAD COMMITTEE ON TERRORISM.  SAULESCU
ASKED WHETHER UGANDA WAS SIGNATORY TO 1972 TREATY, STATING
THAT NO COUNTRY CAN BE COMMITTED TO A PRINCIPLE OF INTER-
NATIONAL LAW WITHOUT ITS CONSENT.  UNIVERSALLY ACCEPTED
DEFINITION OF "TERRORIST ACT" DID NOT EXIST.  HE INTIMATED
THAT WESTERN COUNTRIES HAD RECENTLY APPLAUDED SOVIET
JEWISH
HIJACKING OF SOVIET PLANE IN LENINGRAD.  EMBOFF DID NOT KNOW
WHETHER UGANDA HAD ADHERED TO 1972 TREATY, BUT REITEREATED
TOTAL U.S. OPPOSITION TO HIJACKING FROM ANY SOURCE.  SAULESCU
THEN ASKED IF U.S. COULD SUPPORT "BALANCED" RESOLUTION WHICH
CONDEMNED BOTH VIOLATION OF NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY AND
TERRORIST ACTIONS.  EMBOFF REPLIED THAT BALANCE WAS
INTENTION OF U.S. SPONSORED RESOLUTION, BUT THAT GOR COULD
NOT SUPPORT ANY RESOLUTION WHICH MADE SPECIFIC CONDEMNATIONS OR
WHICH PLACED INCIDENT'S RESPONSIBILITY SOLELY ON ONE PARTY.
5. ##
OF UGANDA PRESIDENT
AMIN'S ASSISTANCE TO OR ACCEPTANCE OF TERRORISTS.  EMBOFF
RESPONDE POSITIVELY AND OPINED THAT EVIDENCE OF ACCEPTANCE
WAS CERTAIN WHILE THAT OF ASSISTANCE WAS ONLY PROBABLE.

6.  COMMENT.  GOR SPOKESMAN MADE IT CLEAR THAT CONDEMNATION
OF TERRORISM ##            ISSUE IN COMPARISON WITH ABSOLUTE
SUPPORT NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY AND TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY.

IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND THE MAGHREB WHICH WAS PRE-

COMMENTS FOR USE AT TIME OF NAC DISCUSSION ARE NOT
ESPECIALLY USEFUL. ON THE OTHER HAND,

BEGIN TEXT:
I. THE ARAB/ISRAELI CONFLICT
1. THE STEP-BY-STEP APPROACH TO MIDDLE EAST NEGOATIATIONS
WHICH PRODUCED THE SECOND DISENGAGEMENT AGREEMENT IN THE
SINAI WAS NOT FOLLOWED BY SIMILARLY POSITIVE RESULTS ON THE
GOLAN HEIGHTS. IT WOULD APPEAR THAT A MORE COMPREHEMSIVE APPROACH
IS NOW NEEDED. THE UNITED STATES REMAINS COMMITTED TOWARDS
WORKING FOR A RETURN TO NEGOTIATIONS IN 1976. INCREASED
CONGRESSIONAL SUPPORT FOR THIS POLICY SHOULD BE NOTED. THE
ISRAELI GOVERNMENT HAS PUT FORWARD A PROPOKSAL THAT THE UNITED
STATES SOUND OUT THE INTERESTED ARAB COUNTRIES ON THE IDEA OF
TERRITORIAL WITHDRAWAL IN EXCHANGE FOR AN AGREEMENT TO END THE
STATE OF BELLIGERENCY. THE UNITED STATES HAS TAKEN UP THIS
INITIATIVE IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY MORE PROMISING ALTERNATIVE,
ALTHOUGH THE STATED ARAB REACTKON HAS BEEN UNFAVOURABLE SO FAR.
2. IN THE MEANTIME THE OUTLOOK FOR AN EARLY RESUMPTION
OF THE GENEVA CONFERENCE REMAINS DIM. WHILE THE PARTIES
CONCERNED PUBLICLY FAVOUR A RETURN TO GENEVA, THE CONDITIONS
ATTACHED BY SYRIA AND THE SOVIET UNION, PARTICULARLY WITH
RESPECT TO PALESTINIAN PARTICIPATION, EFFECTIVELY PREVLUDE
SUCH A DEVELOPMENT. ISRAEL HAS AGREED ONLY TO REPRESENTATION
BY THE ORIGINAL PARTICIPANTS. ON THIS POINT AS ON OTHERS IT
IS DIFFICULT TO PERCEIVE HOW EARLY PROGRESS CAN BE MADE TOWARDS
A RECONCILIATION BETWEEN ISRAELI AND PALESTINIAN OBJECTIVES.
3. THE ROLE OF THE UNITED NATIONS IN THE MIDDLE EAST
REMAINS IMPORTANT, BOTH WITH RESPECT TO PEACE-KEEPING AND TO
DIPLOMATIC ACTIVITY. THE LATEST UNDOF MANDATE RENEWAL WAS
AGREED TO DISCREETLY BY AYRIA FOLLOWING THEFACE-SAVING VISIT
TO DAMASCUS BY SECRETARY GENERAL WALDHEIM. ON THE DIPLOMATIC
FRONT MR. WALDHEIM PURSUED HIS PERSONAL PEACE EFFORTS IN ISSUING
ON 1ST APRIL A MEMORANDUM ADDRESSED TO THE PARTIES AND DESIGNED
TO SUGGEST A MEANS, IN THE FORM OF A PRELIMINARY CONFERENCE,
TOWARDS RETURNING TO COMPREHEMSIVE NEGOTIATIONS.
4. EGYPT'S ROLE TOWARDS THE CONFLICT HAS CONTINUED TO
BE CHARACTERIZED BY MODERATION. WHILE PUBLICLY PROMOTING THE
ARAB CAUSE AND THE RETURN TO GENEVA TALKS, THE EGYPTIAN
GOVERNMENT IS CONTENT WITH THE RESULTS OF THE SECOND SINAI
AGREEMENT. IT WILL NOT COUNENANCE A DISCUSSION OF THAT
AGREEMENT WITH, OR ITS PUTTING INTO QUESTION BY, OTHER ARAB
COUNTRIES. AT THE SAME TIME, EGYPT HAS TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF
THE EVENTS IN LEBANON TO IMPROVE ITS RELATIONS WITH THE PLO
AND WITH YASSER ARAFAT.
5. SYRIA'S APPROACH TO THE CONFLICT HAS TAKEN THE FORM
OF WAGING A DIPLOMATIC CAMPAIGN AGAINST ISRAEL IN THE UNITED
NATIONS. THIS CAMPAIGN HAS SUCCEEDED IN FURTHER ISOLATING
ISRAELI WITHIN THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. SYRIAN ENERGIES
HAVE BEEN ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY DEVOTED TO LEBANON OVER THE PAST
SIX MONTHS. ALTHOUGH SYRIAN ATTEMPTS TO PACIFY LEBANON MAY BE
SEEN BY ISRAEL AS A THREAT TO EXTEND THE MIDDLE EAST CONFLICT
BY THE PROGRESSIVE TRANSFORMATION OF LEBANON INTO A PROPERLY
ARAB STATE UNDER PREDOMINANTLY SYRIAN INFLUENCE AND CONSEQUEN-
TLY, A FULL-FLEDGED AND ACTIVE PARTICIPANT INTHE ARAB POLIT-
ICAL CAMPAIGN AGAINST ISRAEL, ISRAEL HAS NEVERTHELESS REMAINED
CALM.
6. ISRAEL'S REACTIONS TO ARAB DIPLOMATIC GAINS AT THE
UNITED NATIONS HAVE INCLUDED, INTER ALIA, THE DECISION TO
ESTABLISH NEW SETTLEMENTS IN THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES. THIS
HAS OCCURRED WHILE PUBLIC OPINION IN ISRAEL, AS IN MANY WESTERN
COUNTRIES, HAS DEVELOPED A MORE SOPHISTICATED AWARANESS OF THE
COMPLESITIES OF THE ARAB/ISRAELI DISPUTE AND, IN PARTICULAR,
OF AT LEAST CERTAIN OF THE CONCERNS AND ASPIRATIONS OF THE
PALESTINIANS. THE REGIDITY OF THE GOVT CAN BE ASCRIBED
TO DOMESTIC POLITICAL FACTORS WHICH HAVE TENDED TO WEAKEN THE
AUTHORITY OF PRIME MINISTER RABIN. THESE FACTORS INCLUDE THE
KEEN PUBLIC CONTROVERSY OVER THE POLICH OF ESTABLISHING NEW
SETTLEMENTS IN THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES AND THE RESULTS OF THE
APRIOL MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS IN THE WEST BANK IN WHICH MOST OF THE
WINNERS APPEAR TO BE PALESTINIAN NATIONALISTS, STRONGLY OPPOSED
BOTH TO THE ISRAELI OCCUPATION AND TO JORDANIAN RULE. AMONG
THE MANY OTHER PROBLEMS BESETTING MR. RABIN AND HIS GOVT
IS ISRAEL'S DIFFICULT ECONOMIC SITUATION, WHICH HAS REQUIRED
FURTHER UNPOPULAR BELT-TIGHTENING.
N  7. IN EGYPT, THERE ARE NO SIGNIFCANT CHALLENGES TO
PRESIDENT SADAT'S AUTHORITY AND NONE ARE EXPECTED DURING THE
ELECTIONS IN OCTOBER OF THIS YEAR. VICE PRESIDENT MUBARAK'S
RECENT SUCCESSFUL TRIP TO CHINA HAS STRENGTHENED HIS INTERNAL
POLITICAL STATUS; IN THIS, HE APPEARS TO HAVE HAD PRESIDENT
SADAT'S BLESSING. EGYPT'S ECONOMY REMAINS PRECARIOUS AND
WEIGHED DOWN BY MASSIVE INDEBTEDNESS. THE DEBT PROBLEM MAY
HOWEVER BE ALLEVAITED CONSIDERABLY IF EYGPT WERE TO SUSPEND
PAYMENT OF ALL OR PART OF ITS DEBTS TO THE USSR. WHILE EGYPT
HAS SUCCEEDED IN OBATINING FROM SAUDI ARABIA AND THE GULF
STATES FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR EGYPTIAN INVESTMENT PROJECTS
THE CONGROL OVER THE UTILIZATION OF THOSE FUNDS HAS REMAINED
VESTED IN THE DONOR COUNTRIES. IN THE PRESENT SITUATION,
ALLIANCE COUNTRIES HAVE A CLEAR COLLECTIVE INTEREST IN
PROVIDING EGYPT WITH ECONOMIC SUPPORT NEEDED TO REINFORCE AND
ECNOURAGE PRESIDENT SADAT IN HIS STATEMEN-LIKE AND MODERATE
APPROACH TO THE MIDDLE EAST PROBLEM.
II. THE LEBANON CRISIS
8. THE CURRENT SITUATION IN LEBANON IS CHARACTERIZED BY
CONTINUED FIGHTING BETWEEN A LARGE NUMBER OF POLITICAL AND
RELIGIOUS FACTIONS. THE THREE PRINCIPAL PARTIES TO TH CONFLICT
REMAIN, HOWEVER, THE MARONITE CHRISTIANS, THE LEFTISTS/RADICAL
MUSLIMS AND THE PALESTINIANS.
9. THE MAJOR POLITICAL AIRMS OF THE MARONITE CHRISTIANS
HAVE BEEN TO PRESERVE THE LEBANON AS A CHRISTIAN-DOMINATED
COUNTRY AND TO SUBJECT THE PALESTINIANS TO EFFECTIVE CONTROL
BY MILITARY MEANS.
10. THE LEFTISTS/RADICAL MUSLIM GROUP ON THE OTHER HAND
DESIRES A TRANSOFRMATION OF LEBANESE SOCIETY WITH AN OVERTURN
OF THE OLD SOCIAL ORDER BASED TO A GREAT EXTENT ON VESTED
ECONOMIC INTERESTS. THS GROUP ALSO IDENTIFIES MORE CLOSELY
WITH ARAB NATIONALISM RATHER THAN LEBANESE NATIONALISM.
11. THE PALESTINIANS, WHO HAVE FORMED A SEPARATE
COMMUNITY INSIDE LEBANON'S BORDERS, BUT HAVE REMAINED OUTSIDE
THE BOUNDS OF LEBANESE LAW, FOLLOW A VARIETY OF IDEOLOGIES,
BUT ARE UNITED IN THE BELIEF THAT ALL ARABS SHOULD GIVE FIRST
PRIORITY TO THE PALESTINIAN CAUSE.
12. THE FIGHTING IN LEBANON OOVER THE PAST YEAR HAS
INCREASED THE STRENGTH OF THE LEFTIST/RADICAL MUSLIM FORCES
AND THAT OF THE PALESTINIANS AT THE EXPESE OF THE ONCE-
DOMINANT MARONITE CHRISTIAN AND TRADITIONAL MUSLIM LEADERSHIP.
ONLY THREE YEARS AGO THE MARONITES HAD HOPED TO USE THE LEBANESE
ARMY TO ELIMINTE THE FEDAYEEN PRESENCE. TODAY, HOWEVER, THE
LEBANESE ARMY HAS DISINTEGRATED INTO MUSLIM AND CHRISTIAN
FACTIONS, AND IT IS THE MARONITES WHO AE ON THE DEFENSIVE.
THE FIGHTING HAS LARGELY DESTROYED THE FABRIC OF LEBANESE
SOCIETY AND THE LEBANESE POLITICAL SYSTEM TO SUCH AN EXTENT
THAT LEBANON TODAY CAN BE SAID TO BE WITHOUT ANY EFFECTIVE
CENGRAL GOVERNMENT AND IN A STATE F DE FACTO PARTITION. THE
RECENT ELECTION OF A NEW PRESIDENT COULD MEAN THE
RE-ESTABLISHMENT OF A CENTRAL GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY. HOWEVER,
MUCH DEPENDS ON WHEN MR. SARKIS WILL TAKE OFFICE AND WHTHER
HE WILL BE ABLE TO INTRODUCE SUFFICIENT SECURITY TO ALLOW THE
POLITICAL PROCESSES OF ACCOMMODATION AMONG THE VARIOUS
FACTIONS TO SET IN.
13. THE ALESTINIANS HAVE PLAYED A MAJOR ROLE IN THE
LEBANESE CRISIS AND HAVE BEEN THE BACKBONE OF TH LEFTIST/
RADICAL MUYLIM SIDE. SYRIAN ATTEMPTS TO INFLUENCE THE PLO,
NOTABLY THE SYRIAN ATTEMPT TO UTILIZE THE SAIGA AND THE
PEOPLE'S LIBERATION ARMY (PLA) TO ENFORCE A "PAX SYRIANA"
IN MARCH 1976, AVE LED TO STRAINS BETWEEEN YASSIR ARAFAT AND
THE SYRIAN GOVT WHICH HAVE COME TO A HEAD FOLLOWING THE
RECENT DIRECT SYRIAN MILITARY INTERVENTION OF 1ST JUNE, 1976.
CONCURRENTLY, THERE HAS BEEN AN IMPROVEMENT IN RELATIONS
BETWEEN THE PLO MODERATES, ED BY ARAFAT, AND EGYPT.
14. THE SRYIGANS' MAIN CONCERN THROUGHOUT THE CRISIS HAS
BEEN TO DAMP DOWN THE FIGHTING, PROMOTE A MODERATE POLITICAL
SETTLEMENT AND TO SAFEGUARD LEBANON'S TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY AND
UNITY. AT THE SAME TIME THE SYRIANS STILL WISH TO AOVID BEING
DRAWN INTO LEBANON IN SUCH A WAY AS TO RISK A CONFRONATION
WITH ISRAEL IN SOUTH LEBANON THE SYRIANS ARE LIKELY TO BE
FACED WITH A CONTINUING CRISIS WHICH WILL CONSUME MUCH OF THEIR
TIME AND ENERGY FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE AND WHICH WILL
REDUCE RHTE AMOUNT OF ATTTNTION THAT THEY CAN GIVE THE ARAB/
ISRAELI DISPUTE.
15. INN EXTERNAL RELATIONS THE OBJECTIVES OF THE SYRIANS
IN LEBANON WILL BE HIGHLY IMPORTANT, BUT ITS EEMS LIKELY
THAT THEY WILL CONTINUE TO BAKC THE MORE MODERATE MOSLEM LEADERS
WHO WOULD PROBABLY NOT WISH TO SEE LEBANON ASSSUME AN ACTIVIST
ROLE IN ARAB/ISRAELI ISSUES.
16. THE OUTLOOK IN LEBANON IS A LONG PERIOD OF POLITICAL
INSTABILITY AND THE CONTINUATION OF A "DE FAVTO" PARTITION OF
THE COUNTRY. DESPITE THE CAUTIOUS ATTITUDE DISPLAYED BY THE
ISRAELI GOVT THE DANGER REMAINS THA THE LEBANESE CRISIS
COULD TRIGGER A NEW MIDDLE EAST WAR.
17. THE DECLARATION MADE IN NEW-ORLEANS ON THE 21ST OF MAY
BY THE FRENCH PRESIDENT HAS BEEN GREETED SOMEWHAT PRECIPITOUSLY
IN THE ARAB CAPITALS WITH CLEARCUT RESERVATIONS. IT IS
NOTICEABLE THAT THE IDEA OF A FREENCH PARTICIPATION IN THE
CONTROL OF THE CEASE-FIRE WAS FIRST FORMULATED ON THE 16TH OF
APRIL IN BEIRUT BY THE FRENCH EMISSARY, MR. GORSE, AND
REFORMULATED OFFICIALLY THE 6TH OF MAY BY THE MINISTER FOR
FOREIGN AFFAIRS BEFORE THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY. THE POSSIBLE
DISPATCH OF FRENCH FORCES TO LEBANON WAS SUBJECT TO 3 PRE-
REQUISITIES:
- PRIOR IMPLEMENTATION OF A CEASE-FIRE;
- FORMAL REQUEST BY THE LEGAL AUTHORITIES OF LEBANON;
- AGREEMENT OF ALL CONCERNED PARTIES.
18. LOOKING TO THE FUTURE, THE FRENCH GOVT REMAINS
READY TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY OPERATION AIMING AT BRIDGING THE
GAP BETWEEN THE CONTENDING GROUPS.
III. THE MAGHREB
WESTERN SAHARA
19. SINCE 26TH FEB, MOROCCO AND MAURITANIA HAVE BEEN
IN CONTROL OF WESTERN SAHARA. THEIR TROOPS ARE, NEVERTHELESS,
BEING HARASSED IN THE MORE REMOTE PARTS OF THE SAHARA BY
GUERRILLAS OF THE ALGERIAN-BACKED FRENTE PLISARIO INDEPENDENCE
MOVEMENT, WHICH PROCLAIMED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A SHARAN ARAB
DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC ON 27TH FEB.
20. THE EXTENSION OF MOROCCAN AND MAURITANIAN CONTROL OVER
THE WESTERN SAHARA HAS LED TO AN ACUTE CRISIS BETWEEN THESE
COUNTRIES AND ALGERIA; DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WERE FORMALLY BROKEN
OFF ON 7TH MARCH. THE ALGERIANS DO NOT CLAIM THE WESTERN SAHARA
THEMSELVES, BUT SUPPORT THE FRENTE PLISARIO WHICH IS THOUGHT TO
HAVE AN EFFECTIVE STRENGTH OF ABOUT 3,000. APART FROM TWO
INCIDENTS ON 27TH JAN ANAD 15 FEB, THE ALGERIAN ARMED
FORCES HAVE NOT MADE ANY ATTEMPT TO INVIADE THE TERRITORY. THE
ALGERIANS HAVE, NEVERTHEELESS, CONDUCTED A DETERMINED DIPLOMATIC
CAMPAIGN AGAINST MOROCCO AND MAURITANIA. ALTHOUGH THEY HHAVE
NOT RECEIVED THE SUPPORT THEY EXPECTED, PARTICULARLY FROM THE
NON-ALGINED AND THE COMMUNIST COUNTRIES, IT IS CLEAR THAT THEY
INTEND TO RAISE THE QUESTION OF THE WESTERN SAHARA IN THE UN
AND OTHER INT'L FORA.
21. ON 14TH APRIL, MOROCCO AND MAURITANIA AGREED ON A NEW
FRONTIER IN WESTERN SAHARA AND ALSO ON A PROGRAMME OF JOINT
EXPLOITATION OF ITS NATURAL RESOURCES.
22. ALGERIA IS COMMITTED TO SUPPORT FOR THE FRENTE
PLISARIO, BUT IT CLEARLY WISHES TO AVOID OPEN WAR WITH MOROCCO.
POLISARIO ACTIVITY IS, THEREFORE, RESTRICTED TO HIT AND RUN
TACTICS ACROSS THE ALGERIAN/SAHARAN BORDER. IN MILITARY TERMS,
POLISARIO IS INEFFECTIVE WITHOUT ADEQUATE ALGERIAN SUPPORT,
AND EVEN WITH SUCH SUPPORT ITS MILITARY CAPABILITY WILL REMAIN
LIMITED. A CONTINUATION OF SPORADIC BUT LIMIETED GUIERRILA
OPRATION IS LIKELY.
23. ALGERIA'S LONGER-TERM AIM IN SUPPORTING POLISARIO
MAY BE TO SUBERT THE MAURITANIAN REGIME AND POSSIBLY TO UNDER-
MINE THE STABILITY OF THE PRESENT MOROCCAN LEADERSHIP. IT ALSO
PROBABLY SEES ADVANTAGE IN USING IT SUPPORT FOR POLISARIO AS A
MEANS OF EXERTING PRESSURE ON ITS NEIGHBOURS AND, IN PARTICULAR,
TO OBTAIN MOROCCAN RATIFICATION OF THE 1973 BILATERAL FRONITER
AGREEMTN. THE PROBLEM OF WESTERN SAHARA IS, THEREFORE, LIKELY
TO CONTINUE TO SOUR RELATIONS BETWEEN MOROCCO AND LAGERIA FOR
THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.
DOMESTIC SITUATION IN THE MAGHREB STATES
24. IN ALGERIA, THEE IS EVIDENCE OF DISSATISFACTION WITH
BOUMEDIENE'S STYLE OF GOVT AND SAHARAN POLICIES AS WELL
AS ACUTE ECONOMIC DIFFICULTIES. IN MARCH. FOUR RESPECTED
FIGURES FROM THE OLDER GENERATION CIRCULATED A DOCUMENT
CRITICIZING BOTH THE AUTOCRATIC CHARACTER OF THE REGIME AND ITS
SAHARAN POLICY. IN ADDITION, THE AGRARIAN REVOLUTION HAS
ENCOUNTERED A VRIETY OF DIFFUCLITES, AND THE REGIME IS TROUBLED
BY LINGERING ECONOMIC PROBLEMS, INCUDING HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT AND
SHORTGES OF BASIC COMMODITIES. AN UNANTICIPTED DECLINE IN OIL
AND NATURAL GAS EXPORTS, COUPLED WITH SLUMPING PRICES, HAVE CUT
INTO ALGERIAN REGENEUES. UNLESS THESE TRENDS ARE REVERSED OR
ALGERIA RAISES MUCH MORE CAPITAL ON THE INT'L MARKET,
THE AFFECTS MAY SOON BE FELT ON THE  OUNTRY'S DEVELOPMENT
PROGRAMME. TO SOLIDFY ALGERIA'S "SOCIALIST OPTION", THE
GOVERNMENT ISSUED IN APRIL A LENGTHY DRAFT OF THE NATIONAL
CHARTER, WHICH IS TO SERVE AS THE PRELUDE TO A CONSTIATUION
AND NATIONAL ELECTINS LATER THIS YEAR. IT IS UNLIKELY THAT
THIS WILL LEAD TO ANY GENUINE DEMOCRATIZATION OF THE REGIME.
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT BOUMEDIENE REGIME IS IN DANGER.
25. THE DISPUTE OVER THE WESTERN SAHARA HAS DOMINATED
MOROCCAN POLITICS DURING THE LAST YEAR. KING HASSAN WAS UNDER
CONSIDERABLE PRESSURE FROM THE MAIN OPPOSITION PARTIES TO
FULFIL HIS PROMISE TO GAIN CONTROL OF THE WESTERN SAHARA BY
THE END OF 1975. THE EXTENSION OF MOROCCAN CONTROL OVER THE
NORTHERN PART OF THE WESTERN SHARA HAS SILENCED THE GOVT'S
CRITICS, AND IT IS NOW LIKELY THAT THE OPPOSITION PARTIES WILL
TAKE PART WITHOUT DEMUR IN THE MUNICPAL AND GENERAL ELECTIONS
DUE TO BE HELD INTHE SUMMER. NEVERTHELESS, THERE ARE UNDER-
LYING SOCIA TENSIONS, AND THE FUTURE ATTITUDES OF THE OFFICER
CLASS IN THE ARMED FORCES WILL BE A DETERMINING FATOR FOR
STABILITY.
26. THE MOROCCAN BALANCE OF TRADE SUFFERED IN 1975 FROM
THE WEAKENING OF THE PHOSPHATE MARKET AND POOR HARVESTS.
DESPITE THIS SETBACK, ECONOMIC ACTIVITY HAS BEEN HIGH:
INFLATION HAS BEEN KEPT BELOW 10PERCENT, AND THE MOROCCANS HAVE
OBTAINED SIZEABLE LOANS FROM EUROPEAN AND ARAB SOURCES.
PROVIDED THAT THE DEMANDS FOR PHOSPHATES PICKS UP, THE ECONOMIC
OUTLOOK WLL REMAIN GOOD, AND THE AVERAGE GROWTH RATE OF THE
GDP IS EXPECTED TO BE ABOUT 6.5 PERCENT OVER THE PERIOD OF THE
1973-77 DEVELOPMENT PLAN.
27. DESPITE ILL-HEALTH, PRESIDENT BOURGUIBA OF TUNISIA
REMAINS IN A STRONG POSITION, ALTHOUGH HE HAS TO RELY
INCREASINGLY ON HIS NOMINATED SUCCESSOR, PRIME MINISTER NOUIRA,
FOR THE DAY TO DAY ADMINISTRATION OF THE COUNTRY. THE LEADING
OPPONENT OF THE REGIME IS THE EXILED MINISTER AHMED BEN SALAH,
WHO TRIED IN 1975 TO FORM AN ALLIANCE BETWEEN HIS MOUVEMENT
DE L'UNITE POPULAIRE AND OTHER OPPOSITION GROUPS, INCLUDING THE
MARXISTS-LENINISTS, BA'ATHISTS AND THE COMMUNIST PARTY. THERE
HAVE BEEN CONTINUING ARRESTS AND TRIALS OF THE GOVERNMENT'S
OPPONENTS. ALTHOUGH PRESIDENT BOURGUIBA HAS TAKEN THESE THREATS
SERIOUSLY AND HAS GONE OUT OF HIS WAY TO CRITICIZE BEN SALAH IN
A NUMBER OF SPEECHES, THE REGIME IS STABLE. DESPITE A POOR
BALANCE OF TRADE IN 1975, BECAUSE THE ECONOMY IS SOUNDLY BASED:
THE RATE OF GROWTH OF THE GDP IS AROUND 9PERCENT, AND TUNISIA
CONTINUES TO ATTRACT INVESTMENT FROM ABROAD.
28. TUNISIA IS ONE OF THE MORE MODERATE ARAB COUNTRIES.
ITS RELATONS WITH MOROCCO ARE GOOD AND WITH ALGERIA COOL.
ITS YMPATHY FOR MOROCCAN POLICIES ON WESTERN SAHARA HAS
AFFECTED BOTH. RELATIONS WITH LIBYA ARE POORT. THE GOVT'S
FOREIGN POLCY REMAINS PRO-WESTERN: TUNISIA'S RETATIONS WITH
G EEC#HAVE BEEN SRENGTHENED AS THEVRESULT OF THE CONCLUSION
OF THE EEC/MAGHREB NEGOTIATIONS.
29. EVENTS IN LIBYA SINCE THE ATTEMPTED COUP LAST SUMMER
HAVE TENDED TO EXPOSE GADAFY IN AN INCREASINGLY ISOLATED,
AUTOCRATIC POSITION; THE PARTY GENERAL CONGRESS IN JANUARY 1976
AMOUNTED TO A BLATANT REASSERTION OF AUTHORITY BY GADAFY WITH
LITTLE PRETENCE OF CONSENSUS GOVERNMENT THROUGH THE RUMP
REVOLUTIONARY COMMAND COUNCIL. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE CONTINUED
RUMOURS OF CONSPIRACIES AGAINST GADAFY AND THERE HAS BEEN OPEN
REVOLT BY STUDENTS IN BENGHAZI AND TRIPOLI, GADAFY'S GRIP ON
INTERNAL SECURITY APPEARS TO BE FIRM. BUT GADAFY'S ENERGIES
ARE INCREASINGLY DIRECTED TOWARDS PRESERVING HIS OWN POSITION,
AND THERE IS STAGNATION AT ALL LEVELS OF ADMINISTRATION AND IN
THE ECONOMY.
30. LIBYAS RELATIONSMWITH ITS NEIGHBOURS, EGYPT AND
TUNISIA, DETERIORATED AGAIN IN THE BEGINNING OF  1976. ARMED
LIBYAN AGENTS WERE ARRESTED IN BOTH EGYPT AND TUNISIA, AND IT
SEEMS LIKELY THAT THEIR OBJECTIVES WERE, ON THE ONE HAND, TO
EBDUCT BY FORCE THE DEFECTING RCC MEMBER, MUHAISHI, FROM
CAIRO AND, ON THE OTHER, ACCORDING TO THE TUNISIANS, TO ASSASS-
INATE THEIR PRIME MINISTER. GADAFY REACTED TO THE CONSIDERABLE
PUBLICITY GIVEN TO THESE INCIDENTS BY EXPELLING SEVERAL
THOUSAND EYPGITAN AND TUNISIAN WORKERS FROM LIBYA, ALTHOUGH
THIS WAS ONLY A FRACTION OF THE TOTAL. TENSION HAD SUBSIDED
BY MAY 1976, ALTHOUGH BOTH EGYPT AND TUNISIA ARE REPORED TO
BE CONCERNED ABOUT GADAFY'S SUPPORT FOR SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES
IN THEIR COUNTRIES. GADAFY HAS BEN QUICK TO EXPLOIT ALGERIA'S
ISOLATION OVER THE WESTRN SAHARA ISSUE TO EXPLORE CLOSER UNITY
WITH THIS COUNTRY. POLITICAL UNITY BETWEEN ALGERIA AND LIBYA
IS LIKELY TO BE AN ELUSIVE GOAL, WITH LITTLE GENUINE COMMITMENT
ON EITHER SIDE.
IV. OTHER COUNTRIES OF THE REGION
31. DURING THE PERIOD UNDER REVIEW THERE HAVE BEEN NO
BASIC CHANGES IN THE COUNTRIES OF THE ARABIAN PENINSULA. KING
KHALID AND CROWN PRINCE FAHD OF SAUDI ARABIA APPEAR TO BE
WORKING WELL TOGETHER AND THE TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SOLIDARITY
OF THE ROYAL FAMILY HAS BEEN REAFFIRMED. THE INTRODUCTION OF
NEW TECHNOCRATS INTO IMPORTANT POSITIONS HS IMPROVED THE
EFFECTIVENESS OF THE ADMINISTRATION. NEVERTHELESS THERE ARE
STILL SERIOUS BOTTLENECKS INTHE SAUDI ECONOMY AND SEVERE
INFLATION.
32. SAUDI ARABIA'S MASSIVE FINANCIAL AID TO OTHER ARAB
STATES HAS HELPED IT TO CONTINUE TO EXERCISE AN INFLUENTIAL
ROLE THROUGHOUT THE ARAB WORLD AND IN PARTICULAR IN THE
PENINSULA. ITS ATTEMPTS TO MEDIATE BETWEEN SYRIA AND EGYPT
AND BETWEEN SYRIA AND IRAQ, KING KHALID'S VISIT TO THE GULF
STATES AND PRINCE SULTAN'S VISIT TO THE YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC
ILLUSTRATE THIS.
33. IN DECEMBER 1975 THE SULTAN OF OMAN DECLARED VICTORY
IN THE DHOFAR WAR.. ITANIAN TROOPS HAVE NOT YET BEEN WITHDRAWN,
HOWEVER. ISOLATD GUERRILLA ACTIVITY WITHIN DHOFAR AND SPORADIC
CROSSBORDER BOMBARDMENT FROM THE PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
OF YEMEN (PDRY) CONTINUE AND THERE IS NO SIGN YET OF REDUCED PDRY
SUPPORT FOR THE POPULAR FRONT FOR THE LIBERATION OF AMON (PFLO).
ON 5TH MAY, 1976 THE ESTABLISHMENT OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS
BETWEEN PDRY AND SAUDI ARABIA WAS ANNOUNCED. DESPITE SAUDI
HOPES TO PERSUADE PDRY TO MODERATE ITS EXTREME POLICIES BY THIS
AND BY THE OFFER OF ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE, THERE IS NO SIGN YET
OF A CHANGE IN THE FUNDAMENTAL POLICIES OF PDRY.
34. IN IRAQ, THE BA'ATH GOVT REMAINS FIRMLY IN
POWER THROUGH THE REVOLUTIONARY COMMAND COUNCIL, WHOSE
EFFECTIVE LEADER IS SADAM HUSSEIN. THE EASING OF TENSION BOTH
WITHIN THE COUNTRY AFTER THE END OF THE KURDISH REBELLION,
AND WITH ITS NEIGHBOUR IRAN FOLLIWING THE ALGIERS AGREEMTN IN
1975, COUPLED WITH IRAQ'S INCREASING PROSPERITY AS A RESULT
OF THE RISE IN OIL PRICES, HAS LED THE IRAQIS TO TURN TO THE
WEST FOR ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE WITH THEIR DEVELOPMENT
PROGRAMME BEYOND THAT ALREADY PROVIDED BY THE SOVIET UNION.
IRAQ'S POLITICAL RELATIONS WITH THE ARAB COUNTRIES HAVE
IMPROVED IN THE LAST YEAR THOUGH THERE ARE DIFFERENCES WITH
ARAB OIL PRODUCERS OVER OIL PRICING POLICY. HOWEVER, RELATIONS
WITH SYRIA REMAIN POOR FOR BOTH POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC REASONS.
35. IM IRAN, IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHETHER THE
RESURGENCE PARTY WILL OVERCOME THE ABSENCE OF ANY REAL SENSE
OF PARTICIPATON IN THE IRANIAN POLITICAL STRUCTURE. ON THE
ECONOMIC FRONT THE MOOD IS NOW ONE OF SOBER REAPPRAISAL AND
COST-CONSCIOUSNESS REFLECTED IN GOVERNMENT-INSPRIED CAMPAIGNS
AGAINST PROJITEERING AND CORRUPTION AND THE BUDGET FOR THE
COMING YEAR. BOTTLENECKS AND SHORTAGAS OF LABOUR CONTINUE TO
AFFEDT FOR EXAMPLE THE PORTS AND THE SUPPLY AND CONSTRUCTION
INDUSTRIES IN IRAN AS IN MOST OTHER MIDDLE EAST COUNTRIES.
IRAN REMANS COMITTED TO INCREASING ITS MILITARY CAPABILITY,
BUT CHANGED ECONOMIC CIRCU STANCES AND THE NEED TO ABSORB
SOPHISTICATED EQUIPMENT ALREADY BOUGHT MAY COMBINE TO USHER IN
A PERIOD OF CONSOLIDATION.
36. IRAN'S MOVES TO ORGANIZE FORMAL REGIONAL SECURITY
ARRANGEMENTS IN THE GULF HAVE BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL SO FAR, MAINLY
DUE  TO IRAQI INSISTENCE THAT ANY SUCH ARRANGEMENTS SHOULD BE
CONFINED TO FREEDOM OF NAVIGATION IN THE GLF. THAT THE
IRANIAN PROPOSALS WERE BASED ON GNERAL ACCEPTANCE OF THEIR
MOTIVES IN SAUDI ARABIA AND THE OTHER GULF STATES, DESPITE
IRAN'S WILLINGNESS TO GIVE SAUDI ARABIA A FREE HAND IN THE
ARABIAN PENINSULA.
V. RELATIONS WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD
37. RELATIONS BETWEEN ARAB STATES AND ISRAEL ON THE ONE
HAND AN THE OUTSIDE WORLD ON THE OTHER HAVE CONTINED, TO A
GREAT EXTENT AT LEAST, TO DEPEND ONTHE ARAB/ISRAWLI CONFLICT.
THE ARABS HAVE BEEN QUITE SUCCESSFUL IN USING THE UN, THE
SPECIALIZED AGENCIES AND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCES AS A FORUM
AGAINST ISRAEL BY BRINGING THEIR WEIGHT TO BEAR. THE SOVIET
UNION AND ITS ALLIES HAVE CONTINUED TO LEND THEIR ALMOST
UNCONDITIONAL VERBAL SUPPORT TO EVEN THE MOST RADICAL MOVES
SUCH AS THE RESOLUTION ON ZUIONISM AS A FORM OF RACISM. HOWEVER,
THE INDICATIONS THT THERE IS A LIMIT TO THE ARAB INFLUENCE ON
THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES HVE BECOME MORE EVIDENT OVER THE PAST
SIX MONTHS. THIS WAS LARGELY DUE TO AFRICAN DISENCHANTMENT
AT THE LEVELOF FINANCIAL AID GIVEN BY THE ARAB OIL PRODUCING
COUNTRIES. AS A RESULT OF THIS, ISRAWL QS ABLE, WITHIN LIMITS,
TO IMPROVE ITS BILATERAL RELATIONS, THOGH ONLY INFORMALLY,
WITH SOME AFRIAN COUNTRIES. BUT THE VISIT TO ISRAEL RECENTLY
OF MR. VORSTER, THE SOUTH AFRICAN PREMIER, SEEMS TO HAVE PUT
SOME NEW STRAIN ON ISRAEL'S RELATIONSHIP WITH AFRICAN COUNTRIES.
38. RELATIONS BETWEEN THE ARAB COUNTRIES AND THE WESTERN
WORLD HAVE CONTINUED TO IMPROVE FURTHER BOTH POLITICALLY AND
ECONOMICALLY.
39. CONTRIBUTORY FCTORS HAVE BEEN THE US EFFORTS TOWARDS
A SETTLEMENT OF THE ARAB/ISRAELI CONFLICT AND THE EGYPTIAN
CO-OPERATION WITH THE WESTERN WORLD WHICH THE SAUDIS HAVE
BACKED, ALTHOUGH NOT WITHOUT RESERVATIONS.
40. THE EURO-ARAB DIALOGUE, WHICH STARTED AT THE END OF
1973 AS THE EXPRESSION OF A POLITIAL WILL TO PURSUE A LONG-
TERM CO-OPERATION IN VAROUS FIELDS BETWEEN THE EUROPEAN
COMMUNITY AND THE ARAB WORLD, REACHED A NEW AND MEANINGFUL
STAGE WITH THE FIRST SESSION OF ITS GENERAL COMMITTEE,
HELD IN LUXEMBOURG FROM 18TH-20 TH MAY, 1976.
41. THIS MEETING AFFORDED AN OPPORTUNITY FOR BOTH SIDES
TO CONSIDER THE GENERAL POLICY AND STATE OF THE DIALOGUE. BOTH
PARTIES DISCUSSED ALL ASPECTS OF THE DIALOGUE AND EXCHANGED
STATEMENTSON POLITICAL ISSUES.
42. THE RECOMMENDATONS PASSED IN THE THREE PREVIOUS
MEETINGS OF EXPERTS, INCLUDING THE SETTING UP OF WORKING AND
SPECIALIZED GROUPS, WERE ADOPTED AND THE I PORTANCE OF THE
RELATIVE PROGRESS ACHIEVED UNTIL NOW IN THE VARIOUS FIELDS OF
CO-OPERATION WAS APPRECIATED. THE GENERAL COMMITTEE ALSO
ESTALISHED THE ORGANIZATION AND PROCEDURAL FRAMEWORK FOR
THE DIALOGUE AND RECOMMENDED THAT ALL ITS BODIES PRESS ON WITH
THEIR WORK, ACCORDING TO AN AGREED TIMETABLE.
43. THE NEXT MEETING OF THE GENERAL COMMITTEE IS DUE TO
TAKE PLACE DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 1976 IN AN ARAB CAPITAL.
FURTHERMORE, BOTH PARTIES TO THE DIALOGUE EXPRESSED THEIR
EXPECTATION THAT A MEETING ON THE LEVEL OF FOREIGN MINISTERS
BE HELD AT AN APPROPRIATE DATE.
44. ECONOMIC RELATIONS BETWEEN MOST OF THE IMPORTANT ARAB
COUNTRIES AND THE WEST  ONTINUE TO BE DOMINATED BY PETROLEUM
OR DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE ISSUES. THE POLITICAL INFLUENCE OF THE
ARAB OIL PRODUCERS ON THE POLICIES OF THE NON-ALIGNED HAS
FURTHER DECLINED. SEVERAL PRODUCERS VIGOROUSLY PURSUE ENDEAVOURS
TO REORDER INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC RELATIONS TO THE ADVANAGE OF
THE NON-INDUSTRILIZED COUNTRIES. HOWEVER, THE SPECIAL ROLE OF
ALGERIA ON THE INTERNATIONAL STAGE, WHILE STILL VIGOROUS, HAS
WANED. ISSUES PERTAINING TO THE ARAB BOYCOTT OF ISRAEL MAY PUT
STRAINS ON WESTERN-ARAB COMMERCE.
45. WHILE MOST WESTERN STATES HAVE ADJUSTED TO THE OIL
PRICE INCREASES, THE 10PERCENT RISE OF LAST SEPTEMBER AGGRA-
VATED THE ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL PROBLEMS OF MANY DEVELOPING
COUNTRIES. FEARS PERSIST AMONG CONSUMING COUNTRIES REGARDING
SECURITY OF SUPPLY AND COST. OPEC'S RECNT DECSION IN BALI TO DESIST
FROM A FURTHER PRICE INCREASE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE IN PART TO A
BUILD-UP OF STOCKS BY MANY CONSUMERS, IN PART TO THE ECONOMIC
STATESMANSHIP OF SAUDI ARABIA, AND IN PART TO REDUCED DEMAND,
ESPECIALLY FOR HEAVY CRUDE OIL. SAUDI ARABIA'S FLEXIBLITY
AS THE KEY PRODUCER - IT IS ABLE TO VARY PRODUCTION APPRECIABLY
WITHOUT SACRIFICE TO ITS DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS - WILL LONG GIVE
THE KINGDOM A KEY ROLE IN THE CARTEL.
46. ACTUAL AND I TENTIAL ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE FROM THE
ARAB OIL PRODUCING STATES AND IRAN IS A MAJOR ASPECT OF THEIR
INFLUENCE WITH THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. SAUDI ARABIA, IRAN,
KUWAIT AND THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES ARE STILL THE MAJOR AID
DONORS, THOUGH IRAN'S CASH FLOW SITUATION HAS OCCASIONED A
REASSESSMENT BY TEHRAN OF ITS FOREIGN AID. THE KUWAIT, SAUDI
ARABIA AND ABU DHABI DEVELOPMENT FUNDS ARE SERVING TO
RATIONALIZE THE PROVISION OF CAPITAL.
47. MOST ARAB AID HAS GONE TO FELLOW-ARAB OR
CO-RELIGIONISTS, MUCH OF IT TO EGYPT, JORDAN AND SYRIAN. ARAB
AND IRANIAN AID TO THE CONFRONTATION STATES (AND WESTERN AID
TO EGYPT) SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERPINS THE RECIPIENT REGIMES'
CAPABILITIES TO ESPOUSE RELATIVELY MODERATE APPROACHES TO ARAB/
ISRAEL ISSUES. THE "$3.3 BILLION" ARAB DEVELOPMENT FUND FOR COMM-
ERCIAL INVESTMENTS IN EGYPT HAS YET TO FIND CONCRETE EXPRE-
SSSION; THUS FAR PRESIDENT SADAT SEEMS TO HAVE RECEIVED SOME
$1 BILLION IN PROMISES ONLY.
48. UNDERDEVELOPED NON-ISLAMIC COUNTRIES HAVE CAUSE FOR
COMPLAINT; DISENCHANTMENT IS MOUNTING IN BLACK AFRICA AND
ELSEWHERE. FOR EXAMPLE. WHILE INDIA RECEIVED IN 1975 AN ESTI-
MATED $250 MILLION BY WAY OF DEFERRCED PAYMENT TERMS ON OIL
FROM IRAQ AND IRAN  THIS NOWHERE NEAR COMPENSATED IT FOR
INCREAED OIL COSTS. AT THE DAKAR CONFERENCE OF THE ARAB
LEAGUE AND THE OAU FOREIGN MINISTERS' MEETING IN ARPIL SOME
OF THESE DIFFERENCES EMERGED.
49. HOWEVER IN THE UN, TTE NON-ALIGNED WORLD CONFERENCE
AND IN OTHER FORA, THERE ARE NO SIGNS OF SERIOUS STRAIN BETWEEN
THE OPEC AND NON-OIL DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. THE TWO GROUPS ARE
COLLABORATING COSELY TOGETHER INTHE CONFERENCE ON INT'L
ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION (CIEC). OPEC COUNTRIES CO-CHAIR THREE OF
THE FOUR COMMISSIONS (ENERGY - SAUDI ARABIA, DEVELOPMENT-
ALGERIA, FINANCE-IRAN). IRAQ IS A CONFERENCE PARTICIPANT.
THE FIRST ROUND OF MEETINGS OF THE COMMISSIONS, IN FEBRUARY,
WAS MARKED BY A READINESS ON ALL SIDES TO AVOID CONFRONTATION.
HOWEVER, THE OIL PRODUCERS ARGUED ON FAMILIAR LINES THAT THE
INCREASE IN OIL PRICES SIMPLY REDRESSED A LONG-STANDING IN-
EQUITY. IN TH ENERGY COMMISSION THEY RESISTED LINKAGE OF THE GLOBAL
ENERGY SITUATION WITH WIDER CONSIDERATION OF THE WORLD ECONOMY.
IN THE FINANCE COMMISSION THE SURPLUS COUNTRIES - PRINCIPALLY
SAUDI ARABIA - INSISTED ON DISCUSSING THE PURCHASING POWER OF
THEIR FINANCIAL ASSETS(1).
50. WESTERN GOVTS WHICH ARE CONCERNED ABOUT ASPECTS
OF ARAB BOYCOTT OF ISRAEL REGULATION - ESPECIALLY SECONDARY
BOYCOTTS - FACE POTENTIAL DIFFICULTIES IN THEIR TRADE WITH
SOME ARAB COUNTRIES. INDICATION OF SOME FLEXIBILIYTY IN THE ARABS'
APPLICATION OF THE BOYCOTT PROBABLY REFLECT ARAB NEED FOR
PARTICULARL MILITARY AND VIVILIAN PRODUCTS NOT WIDELY AVAIL-
ABLE. HOWEVEVER, WESTERN GOVERNMENTAL ACTIONS WHICH WOULD BE
PERCEIVED BY THE ARABS AS CONFRONTATIONAL COULD ARREST THIS
TREND TOWARDS PRAGMATISM.
----------------------------------------
(1) AT THE TIME THIS REPORT WAS PREPARED, THE PARTICIPANTS
LACKED DEFINITIVE INFORMATION ON THE OUTCOME  OF THE
NAIROBI UNCTAD CONFERENCE
---------------------------------------
51. WHILST THE TENDENCY TOWARDS BETTER RELATIONS BETWEEN
ARAB COUNTRIES AND THE WESTERN WORLD HAS CONTINUED, THE DEVE-
LOPMENT OF ARAB-SOVIET RELATIONS HAS NOT REACHED THE LEVEL OF
SOVIET EXPECTATIONS. IN EGYPT THE ABROGATION OF THE SOVIET-
EGYPTIAN TREATY OF FREIDNSHIP MARKED AN ALL-TIME LOW. THIS
EGYPTIAN MOVE FOLLOWED MONTHS OF MOUNTING SOVIET PRESSURE ON
SADAT SUCH AS THE REFUSAL TO RESCHEDULE EGYPT'S ENORMOUS DEBTS
AND TO CONTINUE SUPPLIES OF NEW MILITARY EQUIPMENT, SAPRE
PARTS AND EVEN MAINTENANCE WORK.
52. THOUGH SYRIA MAINTAINS CLOSE TIES WITH THE SOVET
UNION, PRESIDENT ASSAD, DESPITE HEAVY DEPENDENCE ON SOVIET
SUPPLIES, HS SUCCEEDED INCONTAINING SOVIET INFLUENCE AND IN
KEEPING HIS OPTIONS OPEN. THE SAME APPLIES TO IRAQ. INTER-
NATIONAL REACTION TO THE SOVIET MIDDLE EAST INITIATIVE OF
APRIL 1976 MAY HAVE REFLECTED IN PART THE DECREASE OF SOVIET
INFLUENCE IN THE REGION DESPITE THE I MPROVEMENT OF ITS POSITION
IN LIBYA AND POSSIBLE SUPPLY OF SOVIET MILITARY EQUIPMENT
TO JORDAN.

1.  IN A RECENT TOUR D'HORIZON WITH CHARGE, GOTG ACTING SECGEN
M.M. SOSSEH REQUESTED BASIC INFORMATION ABOUT ZIONISM, COVERING
BOTH HISTORY OF MOVEMENT, AND HOW IT BECAME EMBROILED IN RACISM
CONTROVERSY DURING 30TH U VA.  HE SAID HE DOUBTED MINISTER, OR
ANY OTHER HIGH GAMBIAN OFFICIAL, HAD CLEAR IDEA WHAT ZIONISM
ALL ABOUT, AND PROMISED INCLUDE RELEVANT ITEMS AMONG FUTURE
BRIEFING MATERIALS PREPARED FOR GAMBIAN DELEGATIONS TO INTERNA-
TIONAL CONFERENCES.
2.  EMBASSY HAS MAINTAINED FRUITFUL DIALOGUE WITH MINEXTAFF ON
VARIETY KEY UN-RELATED ISSUES, NOTABLY KOREA AND PUERTO RICO,
FOR WHICH EXCELLENT MATERIALS HAVE BEEN SUPPLIED BY DEPT TO
POST.  WE HAVE BEEN SOMEWHAT HESITANT TO INITIATE DISCUSSION ARAB-
ISRAELI ISSUES WITH MINISTRY BECAUSE COUNTRY IS MORE THAN 90
PER CENT MUSLIM, OVERWHELMINGLY PRO-ARAB, AND RECEIPIENT INCREAS-
ING AMOUNTS ARAB LARGESSE.
2.  HOWEVER, SOSSEH'S REQUEST OPENS OPPORTUNITY INITIATE LOW
KEY DISCUSSION ZIONISM/RACISM AND PERHAPS OTHER ASPECTS ME
PROBLEM.  CHARGE HAS GIVEN SOSSEH COPY OF WELL WRITTEN
ENCYCLOPEDIA ARTICLE ON HISTORY OF ZIONISM.  SOMETIMES THIS
SMALL EMBASSY IS INADVERTENTLY OMITTED FROM RECEIVING MATERIALS
SENT TO ALL POSTS, THEREFORE CABLES AND/OR AIRGRAMS MAY EXIST
WHICH DISCUSS ZIONSIM/RACISM IN DEPTH, BUT WE CANNOT FIND ANY
IN OUR FILES.  EMBASSY COULD USE SOMETHING ON ZIONISM/RACISM
COMPARABLE TO PUERTO RICO AND KOREA PRESENTATIONS OF PAST
SEVERAL MONTHS, IN DEALING FURTHER WITH THIS GAMBIAN REQUEST.
DEPT'S ASSISTANCE WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED, AND ANY
MATERIALS DEVELOPED MIGHT WELL BE USABLE AT OTHER AF POSTS.

SUMMARY:  COMMENTATORS LAUD IDF'S SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF GOVER-
NMENT'S DARING DECISION TO RESCUE ISRAELI HOSTAGES AND AIR FRANCE
CREW.  PRIME MINISTER RABIN COMES IN FOR SPECIAL PRAISE FROM ALL
QUARTERS.  PRESS WARNS AGAINST EXCESSIVE EUPHORIA, AND URGES CONSTANT
VIGILANCE IN CONTINUING FIGHT AGAINST
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.  COMMENTATORS NOTE THAT FLAGGING NATIONAL
MORALE HAS RECEIVED BADLY-NEEDED AND LONG-AWAITED BOOST.  PRESI-
DENTIAL
MESSAGE IS INTERPRETED AS SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL IN UPCOMING UNSC
DEBATE.  END SUMMARY
1.  ALL NEWSPAPERS JULY 5 DEVOTE EXTENSIVE FRONTPAGE COVERAGE AND
EDITORIAL COMMENTARY TO IDF RESCUE OPERATION OF ISRAELI HOSTAGES AND
AIR FRANCE CREW FROM ENTEBBE AIRPORT.  PRESS ACCOUNTS FOCUS ON
DESCRIPTION OF THE OPERATION, LOCAL AND WORLD REACTION TO IT,
COVERAGE OF RABIN'S KNESSET STATEMENT AND PRESS CONFERENCE WITH
DEFENSE MINISTER PERES AND IDF LEADERS.
2.  ALL EDITORIALS PRAISE THE GOVERNMENT'S DECISION WITH SPECIAL
MENTION FOR THE ROLE PLAYED BY PRIME MINISTER RABIN.  THEY ARE UNAN-
IMOUS
IN LAUDING THE IDF IN SUPERLATIVES FOR ITS HEROISM AND DARING IN
CARRYING OUT RESCUE OPERATION UNDER EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES AND
AT
GREAT DISTANCE FROM ISRAEL.  FOLLOWING IS A SAMPLE OF REPRESENTATIVE
EDITORIAL COMMENT.
3.  JERUSALEM POST DESCRIBES THE OPERATION AS "A LIGHTNING COMMANDO
RAID OF EXCEPTIONAL BRILLIANCE AND DARING", EMPHASIZING THAT "THE
ACTION WAS NOT MERELY A STRIKE FOR ISRAEL'S FREEDOM BUT WAS A BLOW
FOR
HUMANITY AS WELL."  THE EDITORIAL CONCLUDES ON A NOTE OF CAUTION THAT
"WHAT THE COUNTRY SHOULD CONCERN ITSELF WITH IS THE DANGER THAT THE
PRESENT MOOD OF EXULTATION MAY GROW
INTO RECKLESS EUPHORIA.  THE TERRORIST MOVEMENT HAS BEEN BADLY HURT,
BUT IT MAY BREAK OUT AFRESH IN A VINDICTIVE SPASM OF VIOLENCE.  AS
THE PRIME MINISTER SUGGESTED YESTERDAY, FRESH EFFORTS AND NEW
METHODS OF COMBATTING TERRORISM MAY HAVE TO BE CONSIDERED."
4.  AL HAMISHMAR COMMENTS THAT "SINCE THE OCTOBER WAR THE ISRAELI
NATION HAS NOT BEEN SPOILED BY MANY SUCCESSES, AND IT WOULD SEEM THAT
THIS IMPORTANT AND VITAL OPERATION WILL ENABLE THE NATION TO HOLD
ITS HEAD HIGH AND TO HAVE ITS SELF-CONFIDENCE RESTORED."
5.  HAARETZ EDITORIAL, AFTER LAUDING THE GOVERNMENT AND IDF, GOES
ON TO NOTE THAT "THE PRESSURE ON THE GOVERNMENT BY THE HOSTAGES'
FAMILIES HOWEVER UNDERSTANDABLE IT MAY BE REVEALED A WEAK SPOT
WHICH SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN EXPOSED.  THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME
THAT OUR ENEMIES COULD HAVE GAINED THE IMPRESSION THAT THERE IS A
DEFECTIVE ELEMENT IN ISRAEL'S POSTURE OF STEADFASTNESS SINCE IT IS
UNUSUALLY SENSITIVE TO THE SUFFERING OF THE INDIVIDUAL."  HAARRTZ
RECALLS THAT AFTER THE OCTOBER WAR THE MEIR GOVERNMENT WAS SUBJECTED
TO SIMILAR PRESSURE FOR THE RELEASE OF POWS AND THE RETURN OF THE
BODIES FROM EGYPT AND SYRIA, "A PRESSURE WHICH REDUCED THE MANEUV-
ERABILITY OF THE GOVERNMENT IN ITS NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE OTHER
SIDE."
6.  DAVAR WRITES THAT "ISRAEL IS ENTITLED TO EXPECT WORLDWIDE
APPRECIATION FOR THE OPERATION SINCE IT WAS CARRIED OUT NOT ONLY FOR
ITS OWN CITIZENS BUT IN THE INTEREST OF ALL THE OTHER STATES WHICH
ARE VULNERABLE TO THE DANGER OF THE TERRORIST INTERNATIONAL."
7.  DAVAR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT BARNEA NOTES "PRESIDENT FORD'S
UNRESERVED SUPPORT FOR THE OPERATION" AND OBSERVES THAT "THE POLI-
TICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE LIES IN ITS PROMISE OF
GUARANTEED SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL IN THE EXPECTED SECURITY COUNCIL DEBATE
ON UGANDA'S COMPLAINT AND IN ANY OTHER INTERNATIONAL FORUM DEALING
WITH THIS SUBJECT."
8.  HAARETZ POLITICAL COMMENTATOR GOLAN, USUALLY AN OUTSPOKEN CRITIC
OF
THE GOVERNMENT, ANALYZES THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS REGARDING THE
HIJACKED AIRCRAFT.  HE WRITES THAT "AT ALL STAGES THE ISRAELI GOVERN-
MENT
DEMONSTRATED UNSURPASSED LEADERSHIP.  ALL CONTROVERSIES, WHETHER
PETTY
OR LARGE, HAVE VANISHED AND THE LEADERSHIP ACTED IN A UNITED FASHION
TOWARDS ONE GOAL: THE SAFE RELEASE OF THE HOSTAGES.  THE RESULT WAS
BALANCED DECISIONS AND CORRECT STEPS LEADING TO A FINAL RESULT
WHICH NOT ONLY WAS OPERATIONALLY SUCCESSFUL BUT ALSO ACCEPTABLE
IN WORLD CAPITOLS."
9.  HAARETZ MILITARY COMMENTATOR SCHIFF DESCRIBES THE MILITARY AS-
PECTS
OF THE OPERATION, ATTRIBUTING ITS SUCCESS TO "EFFICIENT PLANNING,
TACTICAL BRILLIANCE, SURGICAL PRECISION IN EXECUTION BUT ALSO A GREAT
DEAL OF LUCK."  SCHIFF PRAISES THE "SUPERB INTELLIGENCE JOB ON THE
GROUND" DESCRIBING IT AS "A CENTRAL ELEMENT IN THE SUCCESS OF THE
RESCUE OPERATION".
FINALLY, HE NOTES THAT "IT WAS NOT ONLY AN ISRAELI AND JEWISH
VICTORY OVER PALESTINIAN TERRORISM BUT ALSO THE VICTORY OF CIVILIZA-
TION
OVER ARAB TERRORISM WHICH IN RECENT YEARS HAS JOINED FORCES WITH
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM."

UGANDA ON ENTEBBE
1. MR. JUMBA MASAGAZI, PERMANENT SECRETARY OF UGANDAN
MINISTRY OF EDUCATION AND CHIEF OF HIS GOVERNMENTS DELE-
TO THE 61ST ECOSOC INTERVENED IN THE GENERAL DEBATE JULY 6.
THE FINAL SEVEN MINUTES OF A TWENTY MINUTE STATEMENT WER
DEVOTED TO THE ISRAELI ATTACK AT ANTEBBE WHICH HE CHARACT-
ERIZED AS "SENSELESS,  MONSTROUS INVASION BY ZIONIST
AGGRESSORS." NOTING THAT SOME GOVERNMENTS HAD SENT CON-
GRATULATORY MESSAGES TO THE GOI, HE SAID THAT ALL"PEACE-
LOVING NATIONS" INCLUDING THOSE OF THE OAU HAD CONDEMNED
THE ISRAEL ACTION.
2. HE THEN TRACED THE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS AS VIEWED BY
HIS GOVERNMENT FROM JUNE 27, WHEN THE AIR FRANCE AIRCRAFT
LANDED THROUGH JULY 3. HE HIGH-LIGHTED THE ATTEMPTS OF
PRESIDENT AMIN TO ARRANGE FOR THE RELEASE OF THE HOSTAGES
OF THE HIGHJACKING. THE SECTION OF THE SPEECH ENDED BY
RECALLING THE OAU CONDEMNATION OF THE ISRAELI ATTACK AND THE
AMIN DECLARATION,AND THE REPORTED SYG WALDHEIM STATEMENT
THAT CONDEMNED ISRAEL'S ACTIONS.
3. IN EXERCISE OF HIS RIGHT AT THE END OF THE AFTERNOON
SESSION, ISRAELI OBSERVER SOFFER ALLEGED THAT THE ISRAELI
"RESCU OPERATION" HAD BEEN PROVOKED BY THE COLLABORATION OF
THE UGANDANS WITH THE HIGHJACKERS AND THE REFUSAL OF THE HIGH-
JACKERS TO SERIOUSLY NEGOTATE. HE SAID THAT ISRAEL HAD BEEN
GENUINE IN ITS OFFER TO REALEASE THE REQUESTED PRISONERS, THAT
THERE HAD BEEN NO RESPONSE TO THAT OFFER, AND THAT THE HIGH-
JACKERS HAD ELEVATED THEIR DEMANDS. HE CONCLUDED BY RELATING
THIS INCIDENT TO A SERIES OF TERRORIST ACTIVITIES CONDUCTED BY
THE PLO AND CALLED ON THE WORLD COMMUNITY TO TAKE EFFECTIVE
ACTION TO DEAL WITH TERRORISM IN WHATEVER GUISE. SOFFER SAID
THAT WALDHEIM WAS ISSUING A CORRECTION TO HIS REPORTED PRESS
STATEMENT AND APPEALED TO ECOSOC NOT TO TAKE ANY ACTION WHILE
THE MATTER WAS PENDING BEFORE THE SECURITY COUNCIL.
4. TO CLOSE THE DEBATE UGANDAN REP MASAGAZI AGAIN TOOK THE FLOOR
TO DENY UGANDAN COLLABORATION AND ALL OTHER ALLEGATIONS BY THE

1. WITH BOTH PRIME MINISTER ODVAR NORDLI AND FOREIGN
MINISTER AWAY, INDUSTRY MINISTER (AND ACTING FOREIGN
MINISTER) BJARTMAR GJERDE AND FOREIGN UNDER SECRETARY
THORVALD STOLTENBERG RESPONDED TO REQUESTS FOR
COMMENT ON ISRAEL'S RESCUE OF THE ENTEBBE HOSTAGES.
STOLTENBERG RESPONDED TO PRESS QUERIES ON JULY 4
THAT HE WAS HAPPY SO MANY HOSTAGES WERE RESCUED BUT
KNEW TOO LITTLE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO COMMENT FURTHER.
LATER, ON THE RADIO, HE EMPHASIZED THAT NORWAY'S
GOVERNMENT OPPOSED ALL INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST ACTS.
2. IN HIS OFFICIAL COMMENT, PUBLISHED IN THE JULY 6
PRESS, ACTING FOREIGN MINISTER BJARTMAR GJERDE SAID
THE FOLLOWING (EMBASSY TRANSLATION):
BEGIN TEXT
AS WAS EXPRESSED BY THE FOREIGN UNDER SECRETARY
YESTERDAY, WE ON THE NORWEGIAN SIDE ARE VERY HAPPY
THAT ALMOST ALL THE HOSTAGES WHO WERE HELD IN THE
ENTEBBE AIRPORT WERE RESCUED. AT THE SAME TIME AS
WE WISH TTHE SURVIVORS WELL, THE GOVERNMENT WISHES TO
EXPRESS ITS SYMPATHY WITH THE SURVIVORS OF THOSE WHO
LOST THEIR LIVES DURING THE LIBERATION ACTION. THE
NORWEGIAN GOVERNMENT HAS ALWAYS CLEARLY REJECTED ALL
FORMS OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AND ATTACHES GREAT
IMPORTANCE TO THE FACT THAT THIS TERRORIST OPERATION
WITH INNOCENT PERSONS' LIVES DID NOT SUCCEED. THE
AIR HIGHJACKING AND HAPPENINGS AT THE ENTEBBE AIRPORT
UNDERLINE AGAIN HOW IMPORTANT IT IS THAT WORLD SOCIETY
REACH AGREEMENT ON COMMON MEASURES AGAINST INTERNATIONAL
TERRORISM. NORWAY WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TO CONTRIBUTE
TO SUCH A DEVELOPMENT WITHIN SUCH INTERNATIONAL
ORGANIZATIONS AS THE UNITED NATIONS AND THE
COUNCIL OF EUROPE. INTHIS MATTER, NORWAY WILL MAIN-
TAIN CLOSE CONTACT WITH THE OTHER NORDIC COUNTRIES.

1.  SUMMARY:  TELL ZAATAR BATTLE STILL NOT COMPLETELY OVER, AS
CHRISTIANS APPEAR CAREFUL TO AVOID ADVERSE PUBLICITY OF
BLOODBATH AT END.  INTENSIVE FIGHTING CONTINUES ALONG SECONDARY
FRONTS IN BEIRUT AREA, BUT PALESTINAINS UNABLE RELIEVE BESIEGED
CAMP, BLAMING ADVERSE SYRIAN ARTILLERY FIRE.  FIGHTING
ELSEWHERE IN BEIRUT AREA AND IN OTHER PARTS OF COUNTRY
INDECISIVE.  AL DELEGATION CALLS ON PALESTINIAN/LEFTIST SIDE AS
51ST CEASEFIRE FACES INTO OBLIVION.  FATAH DEPUTY KHALAF
BITTERLY DENOUNCES SYRIAN ROLE AND ARAB STATES' INDIFFERENCE TO
FATE OF TELL ZAATAR, THREATENS END OF ATTEMPTS AT DIALOGUE AND
REPRISALS AGAINST NUMEROUS ARAB REGIMES WHEN CAMP FALLS.
LEBANESE SIDES HARDEN ATTITUDES.  LARGE INTERNATIONAL CONVOY
DEPARTED BEIRUT FOR DAMASCUS EARLY JULY 4.  END SUMMARY.
2.  FOLLOWING GROUND ACTION LULL OF SEVERAL HOURS, DURING WHICH
SHELLING OF CAMP CONTINUED, CHRISTIANS AGAIN MOUNTED ASSAULTS
ON TELL ZAATAR AND ARE NOW WITHIN CAMP PERIMETER.  THOUGH
ASSAULT NOT ENTIRELY SUCCESSFUL, MAJOR GROUND ACTION HAS
:3- 3$.  CHRISTIANS APPEAR STILL UNWILLING TAKE HEAVY
CASUALTIES FINAL PUSH WOULD REQUIRE, BUT THEY ARE CLAIMING
CAMP HAS FALLEN AND ANNOUNCE ENEMY WOUNDED WILL BE TURNED
OVER TO RED CROSS ON JULY 5.  IN TELL ZAATAR AN IMMENSE
FIRE, VISIBLE SEVERAL MILES, BEOAN AT MIDNIGHT JULY 3, BUT WE
DO NOT KNOW CAUSE.  COMTWP
TDPALESTINIAN/LEFTIST ATTACK ON
KAHALE WAS SIMULTANEOUS WITH ASSAULTS ON BSOUSS, BDEDOUN,
HOUMAL AND ARAYA ALL IN SAME AREA.  ALL ASSAULTS
APPARENTLY UNSECCESSFUL.  PALESTINIANS HAVE ANGRILY DENOUNCED
SYRIANS FOR ASSISTING CHRISTIANS IN SEVERAL AREAS BY SHELLING
PALESTINIAN/LEFTIST FORCES, PARTICULARLY RELIEF FORCE AT MONTE
VERDE S
ONG TO RELIEVE TELL ZAATAR.  VIOLENT ARTILLERY
EXCHANGES CONTINUE ALONG BEIRUT'S EAST/WEST DIVIDING LINE
AND HEAVY BUT INDECISIVE FIGHTING CONTINUES AT CHWYAH/AIN
EL-RUMMANEH AND AT HADETH/LAYLAKE.
3.  ELSEWHERE, SYRIANS, HAVE STILL NOT COMPLETELY RETREATED
FROM SIDON AREA AND SHELLED VESSEL ATTEMPTING ENTER PORT JULY 3.
VESSEL SAID BY LEFTISTS TO BE CARRYING FLOUR, BUT THERE IS
EVIDENCE LIBYANS OR OTHERS THINKING ABOUT BRINGING IN ARMS
SHIPMENTS.  IN BEKAA CITIES AND IN NORTH LEBANON, SYRIAN
BLOCKADES AND FIGHTING CONTINUE.  PALESTINIAN SOURCES CLAIM
CLASHES WITH SYRIAN TROOPS INLAKKAR, AT HERMEL AND NEAR
OUYOUN EL-SIMANE.  HOWEVER, VIOLENCE IN FARAYA/OUYOUN
EL-SIMANE AREA APPEARS REDUCED TO ARTILLERY EXCHANGES.
VOICE OF LEBANON (KATAEB) ANNOUNCED NEW DEGENERATION OF
SITUATION IN NORTH LEBANON WITH BOMBARDMENTS IN AREAS OF
RAS-NAHACHE, HAMAT, CHEKKA, ENFE AND AIN IKRINE.
4.  DESPITE CEASEFIRE BREAKDOWN, AL DELEGATION CONTINUED
EFFORTS WITH JULY 3 VISIT TO WEST BEIRUT BY HELICOPTER FROM
DAMASCUS.  SECGEN RIAD, TUNISIAN AND BAHRAINI FOREIGN
MINISTERS, AS WELL AS DEPUTY SECGEN KHOLI AND AL MILITARY
FORCE CHIEF- OF - STAFF COL. CHEDID, MET WITH PALESTINIAN AND
LEFTIST OEADERS AT PLO POLITICAL DEPARTMENT HEADQUARTERS BEFORE
RETURN TO DAMASCUS FOR FURTHER CONSULTATIONS WITH SYRIANS.
ACCORDING TO LEBANESE ARAB ARMY-CONTROLLED RADIO LEBANON,
RIAD HAD ASKED FRANGIE AND GEMAYEL TO ALLOW AL FORCES INTO
TELL ZAATAR AS OBSERVERS.  WE HAVE NO WORD OF RESPONSE
ALTHOUGH RIGHTISTS THEMSELVES MADE SIMILAR REQUEST TO AL
DURING PAST WEEK.  AL THREESOME INTENDS PROCEED TO CAIRO
JULY 4, PERHAPS AFTER ANTOTHER VISIT TO LEB TTU
5.  FATAH NUMBER TWO SALAH KHALAF BROKE THROUGH THINLAYER OF
CORDIALITY REMAINING BETWEEN PALESTINIANS AND DAMASCUS IN
FIRST HIGH-LEVEL PALESTINIAN STATEMENT ATTACKING ASSAD
PERSONALLY AS AUTHOR OF PLOT.  KHALAF DESCRIBES MARONITE
"KFOUR FRONT" AS ONLY A SYRIAN INSTRUMENT AND ATTACK ON TELL
ZAATAR AS PART OF SYRIAN PLOT.  "IF TELL ZAATAR IS TAKEN WE WILL
ERASE THE WORDS CEASEFIRE AND POLITICAL DIALOGUE FROM OUR
DICTIONARY."  KHALAF IMPLICATED REST OF ARAB WORLD AS WELL:
"IF TELL ZAATAR FALLS, MANY ARAB REGIMES WILL FALL AS WELL."
PALESTINIAN RELATIONS WITH ARABS, HE SAID, "WILL BE FUNCTION OF
THEIR POSITIONS ON THE CAMP."  KHALAF ALSO ACCUSES CH TC
EETT
SZFR.#CHA
RBEL KASSIS OF HAVING ACCEPTED DIRECT MILITARY AID
FROM ISRAEL, BUT SAYS PHALANGISTS HAVE TRIED AVOID THIS.
PALESTINIANS REPORTEDLY HAVE KNOWN FOR SOME TIME THAT
RIGHTISTS RECEIVING ISRAELI MILITARY SUPPORT, BUT PUBLIC
STATEMENTS ON TOPIC HAVE BEEN AVOIDED UNTIL THIS PAST WEEK.
PALESTINIANS SEEM TO BE SUGGESTING POINT OF NO RETURN HAS BEEN
REACHED ON COOPERATING WITH LEBANESE RIGHT.  WAFA REPORTS YASSIR
ARAFAT ARRIVED BEIRUT 0300 JULY 4 LOCAL, BUT WE HAVE NO
CONFIRMATION.
6.  ON CHRISTIAN SIDE, HARDENED ATTITUDES ARE ALSO SURFACING.
CHAMOUN MADE STATEMENT JULY 3 SAYING FRANGIE OUGHT NOT
RESIGN BEFORE END OF HIS TERM AS PREMATURE DEPARTURE WOULD
EXPOSE THE HIGHEST OFFICE TO ATTACK.  STATEMENT IS MOST
STRAIGHFORWARD CHAMOUN INDICATION TO DATE THAT HE PUTS NO
STOCK IN SARKIS AND ROUND TABLE.  PIERRE GEMAYEL ISSUED
JULY 3 DECLARATION WITH HIS OLD IDEA THAT PALESTINIANS OUGHT TO
BE DIVIDED AMONG ARAB STATES NOW THAT THEY HAVE DEVIATED FROM
THEIR NATIONAL OBJECTIVES.  GUARDIANS OF THE CEDAR STATED FLATLY
THAT CAIRO ACCORDS ON PALESTINIAN STATUS NOT ACCEPTABLE AS
CEASEFIRE CONDITION SINCE THEY CONSTITUTE ONLY "PARTIAL
SOLUTION" OF PROBLEM.
7.  ON OTHER SIDE OF TOWN, JUMBLATT REPORTED TO HAVE TOLD
AL SECGEN MAHMOUD RIAD THAT PALESTINIANS AND LEBANESE
"NATIONAL MOVEMENT" WILL NOT SIT AT ROUND TABLE SO LONG AS
SINGLE SYRIAN SOLDIER REMAINS IN LEBANON.  SAEB SALAM ISSUED
STATEMENT ACCUSING FRANGIE OF DEALING WITH AL IN DUAL ROLES
AS BOTH CHIEF OF STATE AND LEADER OF "FRONT OF KFOUR."
8.  GERMAN-SPONSORED CONVOY OF SOME 80 VEHICLES LEFT BEIRUT
EAROY JULY 4 FOR DAMASCUS.  INCLUDED AMONG 280 PASSENGERS,
MAILY FOREIGNERS, WERE 30 AMCITS AND DEPENDENTS AND 29
AID/AUB PARTICIPANTS, INTENDING ONWARD TRAVEL TO HOME STATES
FROM DAMASCUS.  SOME 90 AID/AUB STUDENTS REMAIN IN
BEIRUT.  EMBASSY HAS TAKEN POSITION OF URGING THEM TO LEAVE
ON SAME BASIS AS OTHER PERSONS FOR WHOM WE ARE RESPONSIBLE.
AUB CONTINUES TO FUNCTION ON LIMITED BASIS.

TRIPOLI INFO USUN NY
TEL AVIV | UGANDAN ROLE IN AIR FRANCE HIJACKING
NOTAL
1.  ADDRESSEES OF REFTEL HAVE UNDERSTANDABLY ASKED FOR SUCH
EVIDENCE AS IS AVAILABLE AND USEABLE WITH FOREIGN GOVERN-
MENTS REGARDING THE UGANDAN ROLE IN ASSISTING PALESTINIAN
HIJACKERS OF THE AIR FRANCE AIRLINER HELD AT ENTEBBE.
2.  A KEY INDICATION OF GENERAL AMIN'S ATTITUDE IS
CONTAINED IN HIS STATEMENT AT THE OAU AFTER THE ISRAELI
RESCUE OPERATION IN WHICH HE DEFINED HIS ROLE.  IN THE
COURSE OF THIS STATEMENT HE STATED, INTER ALIA, THAT
"THE PRESENCE OF SEVERAL EUROPEANS AMONG THE HIJACKERS
INDICATED THE SUPPORT WHICH THE PALESTINIANS HAD".
SECONDLY, HE STATED, THAT IN HIS VIEW NOT ALL THE
ISRAELIS ABOARD THE AIRLINER DESERVED TO BE EXECUTED.
3.  THESE TWO STATEMENTS REVEAL AMIN'S OWN DESIRE TO
RATIONALIZE THE SYMPATHY HE SHOWED THE HIJACKERS AND
THE JUSTIFICATION FOR THEIR THREATS AGAINST THE
PASSENTERS, OR AT LEAST SOME OF THEM.
4.  THE FOLLOWING ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE HAS DEVELOPED
CONCERNING THE UGANDIAN ROLE.  POSTS MAY USE THIS
INFORMATION AS APPROPRIATE.
5.  TESTIMONY SUGGESTING THAT AMIN WAS NOT IN CAHOOTS
WITH THE HIJACKERS HAS BEEN PROVIDED BY MEMBERS OF THE
AIR FRANCE CREW, WHO MAY BE HOPING TO SAVE THE PLANE.
-- THE FRENCH FLIGHT ENGINEER, ON RETURN TO PARIS,
ON JULY 4, READ A STATEMENT PRAISING AMIN FOR "HIS
CONSTANT CONCERN AND FOR A NURSE AND A DOCTOR PUT
CONSTANTLY AT THE PASSENGERS' DISPOSAL."
-- ON JULY 5, THE COMMANDER OF THE AIR FRANCE PLANE
DENIED THAT UGANDAN SOLDIERS HAD EVER "SUBSTITUTED FOR
THE HIJACKERS," AND SAID THAT "THE WATCH OVER US WAS
EXCLUSIVELY SECURED BY THE HIJACKERS."
WE HAVE HEARD ONE REPORT THAT AMIN'S BEHAVIOR MAY HAVE
BEEN CONDITIONED IN PART BY HIS DESIRE TO EFFECT THE
RELEASE OF PALESTINIANS (OR UGANDIANS?) HELD IN KENYA.
6.  THE FOLLOWING EVIDENCE HOWEVER PRESENTS A DIFFERENT
PICTURE.
-- BASED ON THE DEBRIEFING OF PASSENGERS, THE
GERMAN TERRORIST BOESE RADIOED THE POPULAR FRONT FOR
THE LIBERATION OF PALESTINE (PFLP) OFFICE IN KAMPALA
AND WAS MET ON ARRIVAL AT ENTEBBE BY TWO ADDITIONAL
TERRORISTS AND LATER BY THREE MORE.  UGANDAN TROOPS
ENCIRCLED THE AREA, BUT FRATERNIZED WITH THE TERRORISTS
AND ON OCCASION MAINTAINED GUARD OVER ONE OR ANOTHER
GROUP OF HOSTAGES WHEN NO TERRORIST WAS PRESENT.  THE
REPORT CONCLUDED THAT AMIN WAS COMPLETELY HAND-IN-
GLOVE WITH THE TERRORISTS AND NOTED THE IMPRESSION OF
THE PASSENGERS THAT AMIN WAS IN ON THE AFFAIR FROM
THE BEGINNING.
-- A RELIABLE WESTERN DIPLOMATIC SOURCE (FYI
THE WEST GERMAN EMBASSY IN KAMPALA END FYI) REPORTED
THAT THE UGANDANS HAD NO PRIOR KNOWLEDGE OF THE HIJACKING
BUT THAT THEY WERE ACTIVELY ASSISTING THE TERRORISTS,
THEY BELIEVED.  THE SOURCE UNDERSTOOD THAT AMIN HAD
PERMITTED REINFORCEMENTS TO JOIN THE TERRORISTS.  THESE
REINFORCEMENTS APPARENTLY WERE PALESTINIANS ALREADY IN
UGANDA TRAINING THE ARMY.  ACCORDING TO THE SOURCE,
UGANDAN TROOPS HAD RELIEVED THE TERRORISTS IN GUARDING
THE HOSTAGES DURING THE NIGHT OF JULY 1 SO THAT THE
LATTER COULD SLEEP.
7.  MORE DIRECT EVIDENCE OF UGANDAN BEHAVIOR COMES FROM
EMBASSY PARIS' DEBRIEFING OF AMERICANS AMONG THE
PASSENGERS RELEASED BEFORE THE ISRAELI RAID:
"...ALL (AMERICANS) AGREED THAT AMIN HAD PROBABLY
LEARNED THAT UGANDA WAS THE PLANE'S DESTINATION BEFORE
IT LANDED, AND SOME SPECULATED THAT HE HAD BEEN AWARE
OF THE PLOT BEFORE THE HIJACKING.  BOESE SAID WHEN THEY
LEFT LIBYA FOR UGANDA THAT PERHAPS AMIN WOULD BE AT THE
AIRPORT WAITING FOR THEM.  THE PLANE TAXIED AROUND THE
FIELD FOR ABOUT AN HOUR BEFORE BOESE GOT OFF THE PLANE
AND MADE JOYFUL CONTACT WITH THE FOUR WAITING ARAB
FIGURES....  IT WAS CLEAR THAT AMIN GAVE SUPPORT TO THE
COMMANDOS (I.E., HIJACKERS) SINCE THEY ACQUIRED MORE
AND MORE LETHAL WEAPONS AFTER ARRIVAL AND THE UGANDAN
TROOPS WERE CLEARLY THERE AS A BACK-UP FORCE NOT JUST
'IMPRISONING' COMMANDOS BUT ALSO HELPING IMPRISON
PASSENGERS.  GIVEN THE PHYSICAL SET-UP, THE GREAT
NUMBER OF UGANDANS, AND THEIR CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE
PLO, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE EASY, MOST THOUGHT, FOR
THE UGANDANS TO HAVE DISARMED OR KILLED THE COMMANDOS
HAD THEY WISHED.  IN FACT, THE PASSENGERS BEGAN TO
FEAR THE UGANDANS EVEN MORE THAN THE FOUR ARABS WHO HAD
TAKEN OVER ON ARRIVAL, JUST AS THEY INITIALLY HAD
FEARED THE FOUR ARABS MORE THAN THE ORIGINAL HIJACKERS.
"AMIN HIMSELF MADE NO BONES ABOUT HIS SYMPATHY FOR THE
AIMS OF THE COMMANDOS.  HE SAID THAT HE WAS HAPPY TO
HELP THE COMMANDOS SINCE HE SHARED THEIR OPINIONS.  HE
TOLD THE PASSENGERS THAT IF THEIR GOVERNMENTS WISHED
TO SEE THEM ALIVE, THEY MUST COOPERATE IN MEETING THE
JUST DEMANDS OF THE HIJACKERS."
8.  AMIN'S VARIOUS ACTIONS COULD IN PART BE EXPLAINED
BY HIS ASSERTION THAT NOT TO HAVE ACCEDED TO THE
TERRORIST DEMANDS WOULD HAVE ENDANGERED THE LIVES OF
THE HOSTAGES.  HOWEVER, THE APPARENT USE OF UGANDAN
TROOPS TO GUARD THE HOSTAGES AND AMIN'S OWN STATEMENTS
TO PASSENGERS THAT HE WAS HAPPY TO HELP THE TERRORISTS
SINCE HE SHARED THEIR OPINIONS INDICATE THAT THE
UGANDAN FORCES NOT ONLY MADE NO ATTEMPT TO CAPTURE THE
TERRORISTS, BUT PROVIDED THEM AID AND COMFORT AS WELL.
9.  FOLLOWING ARE ADDITIONAL CITATIONS FROM OPEN PRESS
ACCOUNTS PROVIDED BY ISRAELI EMBASSY, WHICH HELP TO
FLESH OUT THE MATERIAL CITED ABOVE.  BEGIN TEXT
QUOTE FRENCH OFFICIALS SEE SIGNS AMIN, HIJACKERS
COLLUDED (SPECIAL TO THE NEW YORK TIMES) PARIS, JULY 4 -
OFFICIALS AND RELEASED HOSTAGES SAID HERE TODAY THAT
THEY HAD SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE THAT PRESIDENT IDI AMIN
HAD BEEN IN COLLUSION WITH THE HIJACKERS OF AN AIR
FRANCE AIRBUS IN THE SEIZURE OF THE PLANE AS WELL AS
AFTER IT LANDED IN UGANDA ....
A HIGHLY PLACED FRENCH SOURCE SAID THAT PRESIDENT AMIN
HAD REFUSED TO ALLOW PIERRE RENARD, THE FRENCH
AMBASSADOR TO UGANDA, OR A SPECIAL FRENCH ENVOY TO
DEAL WITH THE HIJACKERS DIRECTLY.  WHILE PRESIDENT AMIN
WAS OUT OF THE COUNTRY, MESSAGES (TO AND) FROM ISRAEL
HAD TO BE PASSED BY FRENCH GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVES
THROUGH THE SOMALIAN AMBASSADOR . . .
WHEN GENERAL AMIN RETURNED FROM MAURITIUS YESTERDAY,
HE RESUMED THE ROLE OF MEDIATOR.  HE TOLD THE FRENCH
AMBASSADOR THAT DEMANDS FOR THE RELEASE OF 53 PRO-
PALESTINIAN PRISONERS IN ISRAEL, KENYA AND EUROPE
MUST BE MET BY EARLY TODAY, OR ALL THE HOSTAGES WOULD
BE KILLED.
OFFICIALS HERE POINTED OUT THAT ON THE LIST OF PRISONERS
WERE FIVE UGANDANS HELD IN KENYA ON CHARGES OF ATTEMPTING
TO ASSASSINATE PRESIDENT JOMO KENYATTA . . . ENDQUOTE
(NEW YORK TIMES, JULY 5, 1976)
QUOTE EYE-WITNESSES SPOKE OF IDI AMIN ARRIVING AT
ENTEBBE AND EMBRACING THE LEADER OF THE GANG THAT HAD
HIJACKED THE FRENCH AIRBUS OVER GREECE. END QUOTE
(SUNDAY TIMES, LONDON, JULY 4, 1976) END TEXT.
10.  ACCORDING TO ASSOCIATED PRESS REPORTS, THE LONDON
OBSERVER AND THE SUNDAY TIMES QUOTED SEVERAL OF THE
RELEASED HOSTAGES AS SAYING THAT THERE WAS FULL
COLLABORATION BETWEEN UGANDA'S PRESIDENT IDI AMIN AND
HIS MEN AND THE HIJACKERS:
(A)  WHEN AMIN ARRIVED ON THE SCENE, HE AND THE LEADER
OF THE TERRORISTS EMBRACED; AMIN ALSO SHOOK HANDS WITH
SOME OF THE OTHER HIJACKERS;
(B)  THE SUNDAY TIMES (JULY 4) WROTE THAT "THE UGANDANS
SUPPLIED ADDITIONAL WEAPONS TO THE HIJACKERS," AND THAT
"PALESTINIANS LIVING IN UGANDA ALSO JOINED THE HIJACKERS
AT THE AIRPORT."
(C)  UGANDAN SOLDIERS INTERMITTENTLY TOOK OVER THE
HIJACKERS' GUARD FUNCTIONS, SO THAT THE TERRORISTS
WERE ABLE TO REST UP AND COME BACK IN THE MORNING
REFRESHED.
THE SAME SOURCE CITES REPORTS FROM DIPLOMATIC
SOURCES IN KAMPALA THAT THE HIJACKERS WERE CALM THROUGH-
OUT, AND APPEARED CONFIDENT THAT THE UGANDAN TROOPS WOULD
NOT INTERVENE AGAINST THEM (AS, INDEED, THEY DID NOT).
11.  RELEASED HOSTAGES TOLD A REPORTER OF THE LONDON
OBSERVER, ACCORDING TO REUTERS (JULY 3), THAT UGANDAN
SOLDIERS, UNDER DIRECT ORDERS FROM AMIN, SUPERVISED THE
SEPARATION OF THE JEWISH FROM THE GENTILE PASSENGERS.
12.  ON AUGUST 10, 1975, IDI AMIN WAS QUOTED BY RADIO
KAMPALA AS TELLING OFFICERS AND ENLISTED MEN OF A
UGANDAN ARMORED BRIGADE THAT PLO LEADER YASSIR ARAFAT
HAD SENT PALESTINIAN ARAB PILOTS TO SERVE IN THE
UGANDAN AIR FORCE "IN MILITARY OPERATIONS IN AFRICA
AGAINST IMPERIALISM."
13.  THE PALESTINIAN NEWS AGENCY QUOTES THE "VOICE OF
PALESTINE" RADIO STATION (AUGUST 15, 1975) THAT
PRESIDENT AMIN HAD, ON AUGUST 13, MET WITH THE PALESTINIAN
PILOTS TRAINING IN UGANDA AND, IN THE PRESENCE OF TOP
UGANDAN ARMY OFFICERS, TOLD THEM THAT THEY WERE UNDER
HIS PERSONAL SUPERVISION.  HE ALSO USED THE OCCASION
TO EXPRESS HIS GOVERNMENT'S THANKS TO THE PLO FOR ITS
ASSISTANCE TO UGANDA.  THE SAME SOURCE ON OCTOBER 13
REPORTED THAT A "SUICIDE SQUADRON" OF PALESTINIAN AND
UGANDAN PILOTS HAD UNDERGONE TRAINING IN SOUTHERN UGANDA.
14.  EARLY IN AUGUST 1975, ARAFAT RECEIVED A TELEGRAM
FROM AMIN IN WHICH THE PRESIDENT OF UGANDA NOTIFIED
THE PLO LEADER THAT UGANDA HAD ALLOTTED 5,000 FEDAN
OF LAND TO BE CULTIVATED BY PALESTINIAN ARABS, THIS LAND
TO BE CONSIDERED PLO PROPERTY (MIDDLE EAST NEWS AGENCY,
CAIRO, AUGUST 8, 1975).
15.  THE SUNDAY TIMES OF LONDON SAYS THAT SOME 400
PALESTINIAN ARABS LIVE IN UGANDA, MOST OF THEM IN A
CAMP NEAR ENTEBBE.  THEY ARE EMPLOYED IN THE UGANDAN
ARMY AS MILITARY ADVISERS AND PILOTS, AND AS
BODYGUARDS FOR IDI AMIN.
16.  WE EXPECT ADDITIONAL AND MORE COMPLETE INFORMATION
TOMORROW AND WILL PROVIDE IT.  IN THE INTERIM, ADDRESSEES
SHOULD UTILIZE FIRST OPPORTUNITY TO PASS ON AS MUCH OF
FOREGOING INFORMATION AS MAY BE USEFUL.  CURRENT
EXPECTATION IS THAT SECURITY COUNCIL WILL BEGIN
CONSULTING JULY 7 ON OAU REQUEST FOR SC MEETING WHICH
IS NOW IN HANDS OF ITALIAN SC PRESIDENT, ALTHOUGH
FORMAL MEETING NOT EXPECTED UNTIL JULY 8.   ROBINSON

 * 145837 1976NAIROB06908 0.007136174 | 1976-07-06 | NAIROBI | STATE | CHIT-CHAT WITH KENYATTA
1.  I MET ALONE WITH PRESIDENT KENYATTA AT STATE HOUSE
NAKURU ON BOTH JULY 4 AND 5 TO DISCUSS SUBJECT REPORTED
SEPTEL.  JULY 4 MEETING WAS SHORT; HOWEVER, WHEN PRINCIPAL
BUSINESS HAD BEEN DISCUSSED ON JULY 5 AND I MADE MOVE TO
LEAVE, KENYATTA ASKED ME WHETHER I WOULD LIKE COFFEE.  WE
SETTLED BACK FOR AN ADDITIONAL 45-MINUTES CHIT-CHAT WHICH
I AM REPORTING IN CONSIDERABLE DETAIL BECAUSE IT WAS UNIQUE
FOR ME AND EXTREMELY RARE FOR ANY FOREIGN DIPLOMAT.
2.  ON JULY 4, WHEN WE MET SHORTLY BEFORE 1000,
KENYATTA WAS EXHAUSTED, HAVING BEEN UP SINCE 0230 TALKING
WITH HIS ADVISERS REGARDING HI-JACKING AND ISRAELI RESCUE
OPERATION IN UGANDA, PLUS HIS CONCERN THAT AMIN MIGHT
RETALIATE AGAINST KENYA. HOWEVER, AT NINE A.M. ON JULY 5
KENYATTA WAS RELAXED, THE MAGNETISM HAD RETURNED TO HIS
EYES; HE WAS TALKATIVE, ALERT.  HE HAD LITTLE DIFFICULTY
RISING FROM HIS CHAIR.  HE WORE AN OPEN-NECK, BRIGHT RED
AND WHITE DESIGNED SPORTS SHIRT, AND TWEEDY JACKET WHICH
MATCHED HIS MOOD.
3.  NOTING HIS APPARENT GOOD HEALTH, AND KNOWING OF HIS
RECENT ILL HEALTH, I SAID THAT THE BRIGHTNESS OF HIS SHIRT
SEEMED TO MATCH THE LOOK ON HIS FACE; I HOPED HE WAS WELL.
HE REPLIED THAT HE WAS, ADDING (WITH REFERENCE TO HIS
RECENT SET-BACK) "ONE MUST FACE THESE THINGS."
4.  OUR CONVERSATION, WAITING FOR COFFEE TO COME, TURNED
TO KENYAN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.  I REVIEWED BRIEFLY THE
DEGREE AND INTERESTS OF AMERICAN BUSINESS IN KENYA.  I
NOTED MY OWN PARTICULAR INTEREST, RESULTING TO A LARGE
DEGREE FROM MY NIGERIAN BUSINESS INTERESTS -- WHICH I
DESCRIBED -- IN THE 1960S.  I NOTED THE EMPHASIS WHICH
KENYA -- UNDER PRESIDENT'S LADERSHIP -- HAD PLACED ON
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, WITH RESULTANT SUCESS.  LEADING
CONVERSATION TO USAID INTERESTS, I HIGHLIGHTED ONE PROJECT
ON WHICH I PLACE GREAT IMPORTANCE: STUDY ON SEMI-ARID AREA
OF BARINGO-KERIO.  I POINTED OUT VALUE OF PROJECT IN TERMS
OF PUPULATION GROWTH, LIMITED AND OVERUSE OF CULTIVATED
LAND, NEED FOR EXPANSION, AND ECONOMIC BENEFITS.  KENYATTA
OBSERVED THAT DEVELOPMENT SHOULD MOVE "TOWARD SUDAN" AS
BENEFITS "WOULD NOT ONLY BE ECONOMIC BUT POLITICAL AS
WELL" BRINGING THE PEOPLE MORE TOGETHER. "I WANT TO SEE IT
DEVELOP IN THAT DIRECTION," HE SAID.  KENYATTA THEN TOLD
ME ABOUT HIS SUCCESSES AT THE NAKURU AGRICULTURAL SHOW,
AND -- WITH PRIDE -- INFORMED ME HIS ENTRIES HAD WON PRIZES:
19 FOR CIXRHUXMYE PRESIDENT ABOUT
HIS PLANS TO APPOINT AN AMBASSADOR TO WASHINGTON.  I SAID
I WAS ASKING OUT OF MY OWN CURIOSITY. (COMMENT:  THREE WEEKS
PREVIOUSLY, MOFA PERMSEC LEONARD KIBINGE HAD SUGGESTED TO ME
THAT I ASK KENYATTA SOMETIME; KIBINGE INFORMED ME A LIST
HAD BEEN PREPARED A YEAR AGO, BUT HAD NOT REACHED THE TOP
OF KENYATTA'S DEEP PILE.)  KENYATTA SEEMED SURPRISED KENYA
HAD NO AMBASSADOR IN WASHINGTON, SUMMONED MINISTER OF STATE
KOINANGE INTO THE ROOM, AND ASKED HIM "WHAT IS MAINA DOING?"
KOINANGE EXPLAINED HE WAS AMBASSADOR TO THE U.N.  I ADDED
THAT KIBINGE HAD BEEN AMBASSADOR FOR FIVE YEARS AND THAT WE
THOUGHT HE HAD DONE AN EXCELLENT JOB, BUT THAT HE HAD LEFT
NEARLY TWO YEARS AGO.  THE PRESIDENT SAID WE WOULD "GET ONE,
VERY SOON."  HE THEN ASKED ME WHETHER I WOULD LIKE TO MEET
HIM BEFORE HE IS CHOSEN, WHICH SET KOINANGE INTO A FIT OF
LAUGHTER.  I SAID I WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO MEET THE NEW
AMBASSADOR AFTER HE IS APPOINTED.  KENYATTA CHARGED
KOINANGE TO PURSUE THE MATTER IMMEDIATELY WITH FOREIGN
AFFAIRS. (COMMENT: AT OUR BICENTENNIAL CELEBRATION LATER
IN THE DAY, I INFORMED KIBINGE WHAT HAD BEEN DISCUSSED ON
THIS SUBJECT).
7.  KOINANGE RETIRED, AND WE CONTINUED.  STILL FOLLOWING
A SERIOUS LINE, AND TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE RELAXED
OCCASION, I DECIDED TO PROBE KENYATTA'S CURRENT ATTITUDE
TOWARD THE VISIT OF SECDEF RUMSFELD TO KENYA, AND IN
PARTICULAR THE PRESS COVERAGE GIVEN THE EVENT. BY DOING
SO, I FELT THE PRESIDENT'S PAST "CONCERN" COULD BE PUT
INTO PRESENT PERSPECTIVE.  KENYATTA SAID THAT WHILE HE
WAS ANNOYED WITH THE PUBLICITY AT THE TIME, HE FEELS THE
"NEIGHBORS HAVE BEEN WARNED" AND THAT THIS WAS THE
BENEFIT THAT CAME OUT OF IT.  HE ADDED AN APPRECIATION
FOR MY SUGGESTION AT THE TIME THAT WE ADJOURN THE LARGER
FOR A SMALLER, MORE INFORMAL MEETING WITH SECDEF AT SATE
HOUSE.
8.  TOUCHING INCIDENTALLY ON A COUPLE OF OTHER SUBJECTS,
I SAID THAT I HAD ATTENDED LAST WEEK'S INDEPENDENCE
CELEBRATION IN THE SEYCHELLES AND HAD ENJOYED SEEING
ATTORNEY GENERAL NJONJO AND MINISTER FOR COMMERCE AND
INDUSTRY MWAMUNGA THERE.  THAT I HAD TAKEN BOTH ON A
TOUR OF THE USAF TRACKING STATION AND LUNCH.  KENYATTA
APPEARED PARTICULARLY PLEASED.
9.  ALTHOUGH KENYATTA APPEARED WILLING TO TALK ON, I MADE
A MOVE TO GO, WHICH HE ACCEPTED; I THANKED HIM FOR THE
OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS NOT ONLY FORMAL BUSINESS BUT TO
TALK INFORMALLY.  HE ASKED ME TO GIVE HIS WARM REGARDS
TO SECRETARY KISSINGER AND PRESIDENT FORD.

ADHERED TO AND PALESTINIANS SAYING THERE CAN BE NO DIALOGUE
UNTIL ATTACK ON TELL ZAATAR STOPS.  LEBANESE LEFT SHOWS SIGNS
OF DISSATISFACTION OVER ITS NON-REPRESENTATION AT
JULY 4 MEETING WHICH REPORTEDLY DISCUSSED TELL ZAATAR AS
MOST IMMEDIATE PROBLEM. ON SECONDARY LEVEL, AL DEPUTY
SECGEN KHOLI AND PEACEKEEPING FORCE CHIEF OF STATE COL.
CHEDID MET PIERRE GEMAYEL WHO RENEWED HIS DEM JRTTOGAT
PALESTINIANS RETURN TO THEIR OWN NATIONAL OBJECTIVE
AND BE RESETTLED IN OTHER ARAB COUNTRIES.
3. FROM LATE REPORT JULY 5 WE UNDERSTAND AL HOPES TO ORGANIZE
CEASEFIRE AT TELL ZAATAR TODAY, BUT THIS IS REPORTEDLY
JEOPARDIZED BY MID-MORNING JULY 5 REPORTS OF PALESTINIAN ATTACK
ON CHEKKA, COASTAL VILLAGE AT NORTHERN END OF CHRISTIAN-DOMINATED
TERRITORY SOUTH OF TRIPOLI.
4. CHRISTIANS IN WEST BEIRUT INCREASINGLY DISTURBED OVER
CONTINUED SIGNS OF DE FACTO PARTITION. RAYMOND EDDE ADDRESSEES
YET ANOTHER LIST OF RHETORICAL QUESTIONS, THIS TIME TO
MARONITE "KFOUR FRONT," SAYING CHRISTIANS DARE NOT ANSWER
ACCUSATIONS ON THEIR PARTITION PLANS. DAR AL-AMAL ORGANIZATION
SET UP BY KATAEB SEVERAL MONTHS AGO TO PROVIDE ADMINISTRATIVE
CONTROL OF CHRISTIAN HELD AREAS STILL NOT CALLED A GOVERNMENT,
BUT EAST BEIRUT SECURITY AND ADMINISTRATIVE APPARATUS FAR MORE
DEVELOPED THAN IN WEST BEIRUT. BRANCHES FOR HEALTH, EDUCATION,
TAXATION, ETC., OPERATING AND LEBANESE IN RIGHTIST-CONTROLLED
AREAS SPEAKING OPENLY OF "DECENTRALIZATION" AND
"REGIONALIZATION," IF NOT YET OF EXPLOSIVE TERM "PARTITION."
5. FR TUTOJS "CONSTITUTIONAL DOCUMENT" OF FEBRUARY 14 ONCE AGAIN
UNDER ATTACK, THIS TIME BY "ASSOCIATION OF THE ANCIENTS OF
MAKASSED" WHICH CALLS DOCUMENT " AN AMALGAM OF CONTRADICTORY
IDEAS." GROUP SAYS DOCUMENT IS INAPPLICABLE AND FRANGIE
COMMITTED NEW ERROR WHEN HE MADE IT BASIS HIS RECENT MESSAGE
TO AL.
6. FIGHTING AT TELL ZAATAR IS VIRTUALLY OVER WITH FINAL REDOUBT
TAKEN AND ONLY POCKETS OF RESISTANCE REMAINING. WE UNDERSTAND
THAT MAJORITY REMAINING DEFENDERS HAVE SURRENDERED. RED
CROSS, ON REQUEST OF BOTH SIDES,
HAS UNDERTAKEN EVACUATION OF WOUNDED AND WE UNDERSTAND
SOME 200 PALESTINIAN WOUNDED BROUGHT OUT OF TELL ZAATAR AND
DELIVERED TO RED CROSS ON JULY 3 AND 4. PALESTINIANS CLAIM AL
DEPUTY SECGEN HASSAN KHOLI HAD ARRANGED WITH RED CROSS FOR
TRANSPORT OF PALESTINIAN PRISONERS TO MUSEUM SECTOR FROM WHERE
THEY CAN REACH SABRA QAMP, BUT RIGHTIST MUTE ON SUBJECT.
WESTERN EYEITNESS WHO TOOK CONSIDERABLE RISK OF CROSSING
"GREEN LINE" FROM RIGHTIST SIDE SAYS IT DOUBTFUL RIGHTISTS HAVE
SUFFERED MORE THAN 100 CASUALTIES IN ENTIRE TELL ZAATAR BATTLE.
(YESTERDAY AL REPRESENTATIVE, SABRI AL-KHOULI, WAS SHOT AT WHILE
CROSSING HERE.) EYEWITNESS SAYS CAMP TOTALLY SURROUNDED FOR LAST
FEW DAYS AND CHRISTIANS DID NOT NEED MAKE FINAL ASSAULT AS CAMP
COMPLETELY CUT OFF AND CHRISTIANS DOMINATED CAMP FROM TALAT EL MIR.
KATAEB LEADERSHIP SAYING IT PLANS CLEAN OUT NABAA NEXT, AND
MANY SHIITE INHABITANTS REPORTED LEAVING AREA. NABAA IS UNDER
CONTROL OF LEFTIST AND PALESTINIAN ELEMENTS, AND IS LAST
REMAINING NON-CHRISTIAN ENCLAVE IN EAST BEIRUT.
7. IN BEIRUT AREA, KATAEB SAYS INFILTRATION EFFORTS OF
"PALESTINIANS AND THEIR MERCENARIES" HAVE BEEN REPULSED ALONG
CENTER CITY CONFRONTATION LINE. ACHRAFIYYAH STILL UNDER
BOMBARDMENTS FROM NABAA AND FIREFIGHTS CONTINUE ALONG
BECHARA EL-KHOURY AXIS. VILLENT FIGHTING CONTINUES IN ALEY
DISTRICT ON THE ROAD TO ARAY AND KAHALE. LEFTIST CLAIM TO
HAVE TAKEN VILLAGE OF ARAYA IS APPARENTLY FALSE. VILLAGE OF
BSOUSS AND KAHALE ALSO INVOLVED IN FIGHTING. CONTRARY TO
PREVIOUS REPORTS, HUGE FIRE OF NIGHT JULY 3 AND 4 WAS NOT AT
TELL ZAATAR BUT WAS BURNING OF WOODS AROUND ARAYA. VOICE OF
PALESTININE ANNOUCNES ANOTHER LARGE FOREST FIRE NEAR JDAIDE
FOLLOWING PALESTINIAN BOMBARDMENT OF SABTIE.
8. ELSEWHERE, LEFTIST SOURCES CLAIM SYRIAN ARMY ATTACKED
JOINT PALESTINIAN/LEFTIST GROUPS JULY 4 IN BEKAA. LEFTISTS
MAKE UNSUBSTANTIATED AND PROBABLY FALSE CLAIM THEY HAVE
DESTROYED SYRIAN ARMY HEADQUARTERS AT RAYAK. SYRIAN
BLOCKADES OF BAALBECK AND HERMEL CONTINUE. BOMBARDMENTS
CONTINUE BUT THERE IS NO GROUND ACTION IN NORTH METN OR AT
OUYOUN EL SIMANE. IN NORTH LEBANON, MUTUAL BOMBARDMENTS
CONTINUE BETWEEN TRIPOI AND ZGHORTA AND SOME FIGHTING
CONTINUES IN KOURA DISTRICT. DATE REORT OF BATTLE AT CHEKKA, OTED
ABOVE, INDICATES NORTH MAY BECOME CENTER OF STRIFE IN COMING DAYS.
9. SAEB SALAM FOLLOWED UP JULY 3 STATEMENT BY FATAH NO. 2
SALAH KHALAF ON ISRAELI MILITARY SUPPORT TO RIGHTISTS. SALAM
SAID NOT ONLY HAVE ISRAELIS SENT 40 TANKS TO JOUNIEH, BUT
NATIONAL LIBERAL PARTY AND ITS ALLIES HAVE ON SVERAL OCCASIONS
RECEIVED ARMS AND FUNDS FROM ISRAEL VIA CERTAIN LEBANOESE
AMBASSADORS IN EUROPE. AMIN GEMAYEL ALSO REACTED TO KHALAF
STATEMENT, SAYING IT IS "LIE" THAT HE ONCE TOLD KHALAF THAT
WHERAS HE HAD REFUSED ISRAELI MILITARY AID, CAMILLE CHAMOUN
HAD ACCEPTED IT. FOREIGNER WHO VISITED RIGHTIST HELD AREAS
SAYS CHRISTIAN FIGHTERS MAKING NO BONES ABOUT CARRYING
ISRAELI-SUPPLIED WEAPONS THOUGH SOME
WEAPONS HAVE SERIAL NUMBERS FILED OFF.

ENTABBE AIRPORT, "CLOSE COLLABORATION OF KENYA," AND "REPORTS CLEARLY
REVEALING WELL-PLANNED INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION IN A PLOT TO
VIOLATE AND ABUSE THE TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY OF UGANDA." THE UN

EXCERPTS FROM THE ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER'S STATEMENT TO THE KNESSET
CONCERNING THE RESCUE OF THE HOSTAGES HIJACKED BY PALESTINIAN TERR-
ORISTS AND HELD IN CAPTIVITY IN UGANDA. (USUN 2764, 2773)
SUDANESE COMPLAINT AGAINST LIBYA --
THE UN CIRCULATED THE TEXT OF SUDANESE PERMREP MEDANI'S JULY 4
LETTER TO THE SECURITY COUNCIL PRESIDENT (S/12122) WHICH REQUESTED
AN URGENT SECURITY COUNCIL MEETING AND ENCLOSED AN AIDE MEMOIRE
REPORTING THAT THE SUDANESE GOVERNMENT HAS CONCRETE EVIDENCE TO PROVE
THAT THE ACT OF "ARMED BANDITRY" DESIGNED TO OVERTHROW THE SUDANESE
GOVERNMENT WAS CONCEIVED, PREPARED AND EXECUTED BY THE LIBYAN
GOVERNMENT. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE SUDANCES INFORMED THE SC PRESIDENT
(ITALY) THEY NO LONGER WISHED AN URGENT COUNCIL MEETING. ONLY JULY 6

ISTER KARAME HAS SENT TWO LETTERS TO THE SC PRESIDENT -- ONE THROUGH
EGYPTIAN AMBASSADOR AND ANOTHER THROUGH ITALIAN EMBASSY IN BEIRUT

MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND HIS DECISIONS IN THOSE CAPACITIES ARE
NULL AND VOID, AND THAT COMMUNICATIONS FROM LEBANESE AMB GHORRA SHOULD
BE DISREGARDED UNLESS APPROVED BY KARAME HIMSELF. AMB BENNETT EMP-
HASIZED THAT THE 30-YEAR PRACTICE OF CIRCULATING DOCUMENTS AS REQUEST-
ED BY MEMBER STATES ESTABLISHED PRECEDENT IN WHICH U.S. SETS GREAT
STORE.
CAVAGLIERE REMARKED THAT WAS NOT A "RIGHT," AND BENNETT COUNTERED
THAT A PRACTICE OF SUCH LONG DURATION DID INDEED TAKE ON ASPECTS OF
A "RIGHT," AND THERE WAS A FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE INVOLVED OF NOT ESTAB-
LISHING A PRECEDENT WHEREBY AN SC MEMBER COULD CHALLENGE ANY MEMBER
STATE'S REQUEST THAT HIS GOVERNMENT'S LETTERS OF DOCUMENTS BE CIR-
CULATED AS SC DOCUMENT.
USUN LEARNED THAT THE UN LEGAL COUNSEL OPINION ESSENTIALLY

TRUSTEESHIP COUNCIL -- MICRONESIA
GENERAL DEBATE ON MICRONESIA BEGAN IN THE TC JULY 6 WITH A
STATEMENT BY THE FRENCH REPRESENTATIVE. AT THE REQUEST OF
NAKAYAMA, OF THE CONGRESS OF MICRONESIA, THE TC AGREED TO
ISSUE AS AN OFFICIAL TC DOCUMENT THE TEXT OF THE MICRONESIAN
STATEMENT MAY 1 AT THE LAW OF THE SEA CONFERENCE. THE COUNCIL
ALSO TOOK NOTE OF SECRETARIAT REPORTS ON OFFERS BY MEMBER
STATES OF STUDY AND TRAINING FACILITIES FOR INHABITANTS
OF TRUST TERRITORIES (T/1776) AND ON DISSEMINATION OF
INFORMATION ON THE UN AND THE INTERNATIONAL TRUSTEESHIP
SYSTEM (T/1775). KRIENDLER SAID THE USG WAS ALERT TO THE
NEED TO HELP MICRONESIANS PREPARE FOR THE TERMINATION OF
THE TRUSTEESHIP AGREEMENT AND USDEL HOPED THE SECRETARIAT
WOULD CONSIDER HOW TO HELP MICRONESIANS ATTAIN THE TRAINING
NECESSARY FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH. HE URGED THAT MEMBER STATES
CONSIDER PROVIDING SCHOLARSHIPS. KOVALENKO (USSR) COMPLAINED
THAT INADEQUATE INFORMATION WAS AVAILABLE TO MICRONESIANS
CONCERNING SOVIET SCHOLARSHIPS AND STATED THE U.S. MUST MAKE
EFFORTS TO DISSEMINATE SUCH INFORMATION AS WELL AS INFORMATION
ON TC ACTIVITIES. THE FRENCH REPRESENTATIVE SUPPORTED THE
SOVIET CRITICISM.
GARRIGUE-GUYONNAUD (FRANCE) TOLD THE TC THAT FRANCE DID NOT
WISH TO OPPOSE THE CHOICE OF THE PEOPLE OF THE MARIANAS,
AND THEREFORE ENDORSED THE RESULTS OF THE PLEBISCITE. HE
SUGGESTED FORMULATING PROPOSALS THAT WOULD REMIND ALL
INHABITANTS OF THE ADVANTAGES OF UNITY FOR THE TERRITORY.
ON ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS, HE HOPED EFFORTS WOULD BE
MADE TO IMPROVE THE LIFE OF MICRONESIANS, SUCH AS SMALL ROADS,
OR A PIER, WHERE NEEDED. HE STATED EFFORTS SHOULD BE MADE TO
STRENGTHEN TRADE BETWEEN REGIONS RATHER THAN WITH DISTANT
AREAS, WHICH MIGHT ENCOURAGE DEPENDENCY; SUGGESTED EXACT NATURE
OF COMMONWEALTH STATUS ENVISAGED SHOULD BE KNOWN TO THE INHABITANTS
SO THEY COULD EXPRESS THEIR VIEWS ON IT; AND URGED THE U.S.
TO STRESS ECONOMIC AUTONOMY FOR MICRONESIA, GIVING PRIORITY
TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PRODUCTIVE SECTOR, AS WELL AS THE
POLITICAL EDUCATION OF THE INHABITANTS. (REPEATED INFO

COMMITTEE OF 24 SUBCOMMITTEE ON SMALL TERRITORIES --
THE SUBCOMMITTEE BEGAN CONSIDERATION OF AMERICAN SAMOA
AND THE NEW HEBRIDES JULY 6 AND HEARD STATEMENTS BY THE
REPRESENTATIVES OF THE U.S. AND THE UK.
KRESSLER STATED THAT THE MOST SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT ON
AMERICAN SAMOA HAD CENTERED AROUND THE QUESTION OF THE POPULAR
ELECTION FOR GOVERNOR AND LIENTENANT GOVERNOR. HE NOTED THAT
THE ISSUE HAD BEEN DEFEATED IN THREE REFERENDUMS BUT THAT
ANOTHER WOULD BE HELD AUGUST 31, SUPERVISED BY AN INDEPENDENT
ELECTION COMMISSIONER FROM OUTSIDE AMERICAN SAMOA. IF
THE PEOPLE VOTED AFFIRMATIVELY THE NEXT STEP WOULD BE DEVELOPING
OFFICIAL PROCEDURES FOR THE FUNCTIONING OF AN ELECTIVE GOVERNOR
UNDER THE PRESENT CONSTITUTION. HE REPORTED ON THE SERIOUS
EFFECTS OF THE ECONOMIC RECESSION, WHICH HAD NECESSITATED
STRICT ECONOMIES AND A REQUEST FOR A SPECIAL U.S. APPROPRIATION.
HOWEVER, THE ECONOMY WAS NOW BEGINNING TO SHOW SIGNS OF SLOW
BUT STEADY UPSWING, A NEW AND EXPANDED AIR SERVICE SHOULD
INFLUENCE TOURISM, AND AGRICULTURE WAS BACK TO NORMAL
FOLLOWING THE DROUGHT.
DALTON (UK), SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE UK AND FRANCE WHICH
JOINTLY ADMINISTER THE NEW HEBRIDES, READ PORTIONS OF A JUNE
29 JOINT STATEMENT CONCERNING THE POLICY OF THOSE TWO GOVERN-
MENTS TOWARD FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF THE TERRITORY. HE SAID
A FUNDAMENTAL STEP IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE TERRITORY'S
INSTITUTIONS WAS THE MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS AUG. 16, 1975,
THE FIRST HELD THROUGHOUT THE TERRITORY ON THE BASIS OF
DIRECT UNIVERSAL ADULT SUFFRAGE. PLANS WERE BEING DRAWN
UP TO RATIONALIZE THE JOINT ADMINISTRATION OF THE TERRITORY
WITH THE AIM OF ENSURING THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WAS CLOSELY
ADAPTED TO THE NEEDS OF THE NEW HEBRIDES, HE TOLD THE
SUBCOMMITTEE.

1. SUMMARY: TELL ZAATAR BATTLE STILL NOT COMPLETELY OVER, AS
CHRISTIANS APPEAR CAREFUL TO AVOID ADVERSE PUBLICITY OF
BLOODBATH AT END. INTENSIVE FIGHTING CONTINUES ALONG SECONDARY
FRONTS IN BEIRUT AREA, BUT PALESTINIANS UNABLE RELIEVE BESIEGED
CAMP, BLAMING ADVERSE SYRIAN ARTILLERY FIRE. FIGHTING
ELSEWHERE IN BEIRUT AREA AND IN OTHER PARTS OF COUNTRY
INDECISIVE. AL DELEGATION CALLS ON PALESTINIAN/LEFTIST SIDE AS
51ST CEASEFIRE FACES INTO OBLIVION. FATAH DEPUTY KHALAF
BITTERLY DENOUNCES SYRIAN ROLE AND ARAB STATES' INDIFFERENCE TO
FATE OF TELL ZAATAR, THREATENS END OF ATTEMPTS AT DIALOGUE AND
REPRISALS AGAINST NUMEROUS ARAB REGIMES WHEN CAMP FALLS.
LEBANESE SIDES HARDEN ATTITUDES. LARGE INTERNATIONAL CNONVOY
DEPARTED BEIRUT FOR DAMASCUS EARLY JULY 4. END SUMMARY.
2. FOLLOWING GROUND ACTION LULL OF SEVERAL HOURS, DURING WHICH
SHELLING OF CAMP CONTINUED. CHRISTIANS AGAIN MOUNTED ASSAULTS
ON TELL ZAATAR AND ARE NOW WITHIN CAMP PERIMETER. THOUGH
ASSAULT NOT ENTIRELY SUCCESSFUL, MAJOR GROUND ACTION HAS
CEASED. CHRISTIANS APPEAR STILL UNWILLING TAKE HEAVY
CASUALTIES FINAL PUSH WOULD REQUIRE, BUT THEY ARE CLAIMING
CAMP HAS FALLEN AND ANNOUNCE ENEMY WOUNDED WILL BE TURNED
OVER TO RED CROSS ON JULY 5. IN TELL ZAATAR AN IMMENSE
FIRE, VISIBLE SEVERAL MILES, BEGAN AT MIDNIGHT JULY 3, BUT WE
DO NOT KNOW CAUSE. COMBINED
PALESTINIAN/LEFTIST ATTACK ON
KAHALE WAS SIMULTANEOUS WITH ASSAULTS ON BSOUSS, BDEDOUN,
HOUMAL AND ARAYA ALL IN SAME AREA. ALL ASSUALTS
APPARENTLY UNSUCCESSFUL. PALESTINIANS HAVE ANGRILY DENOUNCED
SYRIANS FOR ASSISTING CHRISTIANS IN SEVERAL AREAS BY SHELLING
PALESTINIAN/LEFTIST FORCES, PARTICULARLY RELIEF FORCE AT MONTE
VERDE SINT
TO RELIEVE TALL ZAATAR. VIOLENT ARTILLERY
EXCHANGES CONTINUE ALONG BEIRUT'S EAST/WEST DIVIDING LINE
AND HEAVY BUT INDECISIVE FIGHTING CONTINUES AT CHWYAH/AIN
EL-RUMMANEH AND AT HADETH/LAYLAKE.
3. ELSEWHERE, SYRIANS, HAVE STILL NOT COMPLETELY RETREATED
FROM SIDON AREA AND SHELLED VESSEL ATTEMPTING ENTER PORT JULY 3.
VESSEL SAID BY LEFTISTS TO BE CARRYING FLOUR, BUT THERE IS
EVIDENCE LIBYANS OR OTHERS THINKING ABOUT BRINGING IN ARMS
SHIPMENTS. IN BEKAA CITIES AND IN NORTH LEBANON, SYRIAN
BLOCKADES AND FIGHTING CONTINUE. PALESTINIAN SOURCES CLAIM
CLASHES WITH SYRIAN TROOPS INLAKKAR, AT HERMEL AND NEAR
OUYOUN EL-SIMANE. HOWEVER, VIOLENCE IN FARAYA/OUYOUN
EL-SIMANE AREA APPEARS REDUCED TO ARTILLERY EXCHANGES.
VOICE OF LEBANONN(KATAEB) ANNOUNCED NEW DEGENERATION OF
SITUATION IN NORTH LEBANON WITH BOMBARDMENTS IN AREAS OF
RAS-NAHACHE, HAMAT, CHEKKA, ENFE AND AIN IKRINE.
4. DESPITE CEASEFIRE BREAKDOWN, AL DELEGATION CONTINUED
EFFORTS WITH JULY 3 VISIT TO WEST BEIRUT BY HELICOPTER FROM
DAMASCUS. SECGEN RIAD, TUNISIAN AND BAHRAINI FOREIGN
MINISTERS, AS WELL AS DEPUTY SECGEN KHOLI AND AL MILITARY
FORCE CHIEF-OF-STAFF COL CHEDID, MET WITH PALESTINIAN AND
LEFTIST LEADERS AT PLO POLITICAL DEPARTMENT HEADQUARTERS BEFORE
RETURN TO DAMASCUS FOR FURTHER CONSULTATIONS WITH SYRIANS.
ACCORDING TO LEBANESE ARAB ARMY-CONTROLLED RADIO LEBANON.
RIAD HAD ASKED FRANGIE AND GEMAYEL TO ALLOW AL FORCES INTO
TELL ZAATAR AS OBSERVERS. WE HAVE NO WORD OF RESPONSE
ALTHOUGH RIGHTISTS THEMSELVES MADE SIMILAR REQUEST TO AL
DURING PAST WEEK. AL THREESOME INTENDS PROCEED TO CAIRO
JULY 4, PERHAPS AFTER ANOTHER VISIT TO LEB TTU
5. FATAH NUMBER TWO SALAH KHALAF BROKE THROUGH THINLAYER OF
CORIALITY REMAINING BETWEEN PALESTINIANS AND DAMASCUS IN
FIRST HIGH-LEVEL PALESTINIAN STATEMENT ATTACKING ASSAD
PERSONNALY AS AUTHOR OF PLOT. KHALAF DESCRIBES MARONITE
"KFOUR FRONT" AS ONLY A SYRIAN INSTRUMENT AND ATTACK ON TELL
ZAATAR AS PART OF SYRIAN PLOT. "IF TELL ZAATAR IS TAKEN WE WILL
ERASE THE WORDS CEASEFIRE AND POLITICAL DIALOGUE FROM OUR
DICTIONARY." KHALAF IMPLICATED REST OF ARAB WORLD AS WELL:
"IF TELL ZAATAR FALLS, MANY ARAB REGIMES WILL FALL AS WELL".
PALESTINIAN RELATIONS WITH ARABS, HE SAID, "WILL BE FUNCTION OF
THEIR POTITIONS ON THE CAMP." KHALAF ALSO ACCUESES CH TO
EETT
SZFR.#CHA
RBFL KASSIS OF HAVING ACCEPTED DIRECT MILITARY AID
FROM ISRAEL, BUT SAYS PHALANGISTS HAVE TRIED AVOID THIS.
PALESTINIANS REPORTEDLY HAVE KNOWN FOR SOME TIME THAT
RIGHTISTS RECEIVING ISRAELI MILITARY SUPPORT, BUT PUBLIC
STATEMENTS ON TOPIC HAVE BEEN AVOIDED UNTIL THIS PAST WEEK.
PALESTINIANS SEEM TO BE SUGGESTING POINT OF NO RETURN HAS BEEN
REACHED ON COOPERATIING WITH LEBANESE RIGHT. WAFA REPORTS YASSIR
ARAFAT ARRIVED BEIRUT 0300 JULY 4 LOCAL, BUT WE HAVE NO
CONFIRMATION.
6. ON CHRISTIAN SIDE, HARDENED ATTITUDES ARE ALSO SURFACING.
CHAMOUND MADE STATEMENT JULY 3 SAYING FRANGIE OUGHT NOT
RESIGN BEFORE END OF HIS TERM AS PREMATURE DEPARTURE WOULD
EXPOSE THE HIGHEST OFFICE TO ATTACK. STATEMENT IS MOST
STRAIGHTFORWARD CHAMOUN INDICATION TO DATE THAT HE PUTS NO
STOCK IN SARKIS AND ROUND TABLE. PIERRE GEMAYEL ISSUED
JULY 3 DECLARATION WITH HIS OLD IDEA THAT PALESTINIANS OUGHT TO
BE DIVIDED AMONG ARAB STATES NOW THAT THEY HAVE DEVIATED FROM
THEIR NATIONAL OBJECTIVES. GUARDIANS OF THE CEDAR STATED FLATLY
THAT CAIRO ACCORDS ON PALESTINIANS STATUS NOT ACCEPTABLE AS
CEASEFIRE CONDITION SINCE THEY CONSTITUTE ONLY "PARTIAL
SOLUTION" OF PROBLEM.
7. ON OTHER SIDE OF TOWN, JUMBLATT REPORTED TO HAVE TOLD
AL SECGEN MAHMOUD RIAD THAT PALESTINIANS AND LEBANESE
"NATIONAL MOVEMENT" WILL NOT SIT AT ROUND TABLE SO LONG AS
SINGLE SYRIAN SOLDIER REMAINS IN LEBANON. SAEB SALAM ISSUED
STATEMENT ACCUSING FRANGIE OF DEALING WITH AL IN DUAL ROLES
AS BOTH CHIEF OF STATE AND LEADER OF "FRONT OF KFOUR."
8. GERMAN-SPONSORED CONVOY OF SOME 80 VEHICLES LEFT BEIRUT
EAROY JULY 4 FOR DAMASCUS. INCLUDED AMONG 280 PASSENGERS,
MAILY FOREIGNERS, WERE 30 AMCITS AND DEPENDENTS AND 29
AID/AUB PARTICIPANTS, INTENDING ONWARD TRAVEL TO HOME STATES
FROM DAMASCUS. SOME 90 AID/AUH STUDENTS REMAIN IN
BEIRUT. EMBASSY HAS TAKEN POSITION OF URGING THEM TO LEAVE
ON SAME BASIS AS OTHER PERSONS FOR WHOM WE ARE RESPONSIBLE.
AUB CONTINUES TO FUNCTION ON LIMITED BASIS.

USCINCEUR | DEPARTMENT PRESS BRIEFING - JULY 6
FOR YOUR INFORMATION AND GUIDANCE FOLLOWING ARE EXCERPTS
FROM DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN'S PRESS BRIEFING JULY 6, 1976:
Q.  WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT A NUMBER OF THINGS ASSOCIATED
WITH THE ISRAELI COMMANDO RAID; NAMELY, HOW MANY AMERICAN
CITIZENS WERE INVOLVED?
A.  THE FIGURE I HAVE IS THREE AMERICANS, ONE OF WHOM IS
MARRIED TO AN ISRAELI.
Q.  DO YOU HAVE THEIR NAMES, PLEASE?
A.  MR. AND MRS. GEORGE KARFUNKEL.  I DO NOT HAVE AN AD-
DRESS ON THAT.  MRS. JANET ALMOG.  SHE IS MARRIED TO AN
ISRAELI.
Q.  ALL THREE ARE NOW IN JERUSALEM?
A.  I UNDERSTAND THAT MRS. ALMOG HAS RETURNED TO ISRAEL.
REGARDING THE KARFUNKELS, I AM NOT CERTAIN OF THEIR WHERE-
ABOUTS RIGHT AT THE MOMENT.
MR. BROWN:  THEY ARE ON THEIR WAY BACK TO THE UNITED
STATES?
MR. TRATTNER:  I THINK THEY WERE DUE TO RETURN TO NEW YORK
LAST NIGHT, AND I THINK NEW YORK IS THEIR HOME CITY.
Q.  KARFUNKEL'S HOME IS NEW YORK?
MR. TRATTNER:  I BELIEVE SO.
MR. BROWN:  WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS ACCURATE BUT WILL CHECK
FOR YOU, MURREY.
Q.  DO YOU KNOW MRS. ALMOG'S HOME?
A.  AS I SAY, SHE IS MARRIED TO AN ISRAELI AND IT IS MY
UNDERSTANDING SHE LIVES IN ISRAEL.
Q.  WERE THERE ANY AMERICANS AMONG THE HUNDRED AND THOSE
WHO DIED IN UGANDA?
A.  NOT AS FAR AS I KNOW.
Q.  ONLY THREE AMERICANS?
A.  YES.  THE OTHER AMERICANS ON BOARD THE HIJACKED AIR-
CRAFT WERE RELEASED IN THE INITIAL GROUP AS YOU RECALL.
AND I BELIEVE THE FINAL FIGURE WAS--I CANNOT GIVE YOU OFF
THE TOP OF MY HEAD THE FINAL FIGURE, BUT IT WAS AROUND
FIFTEEN.  AND I WILL GET YOU THE PRECISE NUMBER OF AMERI-
CANS RELEASED IN THE FIRST GROUP, AND IF THERE IS ANY
CHANGE FROM THIS FIGURE OF THREE WHICH I HAVE JUST GIVEN
YOU FOR THE RELEASE ON SATURDAY I WILL ADVISE YOU.
Q.  COULD YOU GO THROUGH THE SEQUENCE OF WHAT INFORMATION
YOU HAVE AVAILABLE AS TO WHAT THE UNITED STATES WAS
NOTIFIED ABOUT, WHEN IT WAS NOTIFIED, AND WHAT IT DID?
A.  MURREY, AS I UNDERSTAND IT, THE SECRETARY WAS TOLD OF
THE RAID AFTER IT HAD ALREADY STARTED.  THAT WAS ABOUT
6:00 P.M. SATURDAY EVENING, AND THAT WAS OUR FIRST KNOWL-
EDGE OF IT.
Q.  DO YOU KNOW AT WHAT POINT THE RAID WAS IN AT THAT
TIME?
A.  I DO NOT KNOW, MURREY.
Q.  IT WAS ABOUT 6:00 P.M. SATURDAY EVENING?
A.  YES.
Q.  WASN'T THE RAID OVER AND THE FLIGHT BACK, AT THAT
TIME?
A.  IT DEPENDS ON HOW YOU DEFINE "THE RAID".  PERHAPS THE
FLIGHT WAS IN PROGRESS BACK, BUT I AM TOLD THE RAID WAS
NOT YET COMPLETED AT THAT POINT.  BUT IT WAS ALREADY WELL
UNDER WAY, AT WHICH POINT THE SECRETARY WAS MADE AWARE
OF IT.
Q.  WE HAVE SOME DISCREPANCY HERE, WHICH IS WHY I AM ASK-
ING ABOUT THE TIME FACTOR, BECAUSE I UNDERSTOOD THE
ISRAELI EMBASSY TO SAY THAT THE SECRETARY, THE UNITED
STATES, WAS NOTIFIED AFTER THE PLANES TOOK OFF. AND THAT
WOULD BE A MATTER OF A CONSIDERABLY DIFFERENT TIME FACTOR
UNLESS THERE IS SOME MISUNDERSTANDING HERE.
A.  TOOK OFF FROM WHERE WOULD BE THE QUESTION.
Q.  I THOUGHT THEY MEANT AFTER THEY TOOK OFF FROM ISRAELI
TERRITORY.
A.  NO, I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT IS ACCURATE.  I CANNOT GIVE
YOU A MORE PRECISE TIME, MURREY, THAN ROUGHLY 6:00 P.M.
SATURDAY EVENING, AND THAT THE RAID WAS ALREADY IN
PROGRESS.
Q.  WHAT WAS THE FIRST INFORMATION THE UNITED STATES HAD
ABOUT THE RAID?
A.  I JUST SAID THAT IS OUR FIRST INFORMATION.
Q.  ALL RIGHT.  IS THE SITUATION THAT AMERICAN INTELLI-
GENCE HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE RAID BEFORE THE ISRAELI
EMBASSY NOTIFIED THE UNITED STATES?
A.  I AM NOT GOING TO GO INTO THE QUESTION OF INTELLIGENCE,
MURREY, BUT WILL REAFFIRM THAT OUR FIRST KNOWLEDGE OF THE
RAID BY THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE WAS APPROXIMATELY 6:00 P.M.
SATURDAY NIGHT.
Q.  I WOULD LIKE TO REPEAT MY QUESTION.  I WAS ASKING WHAT
THE FIRST KNOWLEDGE WAS OF THE UNITED STATES.
A.  I AM JUST GOING TO HAVE TO REPEAT WHAT I SAID, MURREY.
THAT IS OUR FIRST KNOWLEDGE OF IT.
Q.  ALL RIGHT, YOU ARE SAYING THAT UNITED STATES INTEL-
LIGENCE HAD NO ADVANCE KNOWLEDGE OF THE RAID?
A.  AS FAR AS I KNOW, IT DID NOT.
Q.  ALL RIGHT.
Q.  FRED, DOES THE QUESTION ARISE AS TO THE USE OF US-
SUPPLIED AIRCRAFT IN THIS RAID INTO UGANDA?  THOSE PLANES
ARE PROVIDED, AS I UNDERSTAND OUR LEGISLATION, SOLELY FOR
THE SELF-DEFENSE OF THE RECIPIENT COUNTRY.
A.  I IMAGINE THAT WOULD BE A SUBJECTIVE DETERMINATION.
I AM NOT INFORMED ON THAT, LARS.
Q.  DOES THE DEPARTMENT ALSO HAVE A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING
AS TO WHETHER UGANDA CONNIVED IN THE KIDNAPING OF THE
HOSTAGES?  THERE ARE CONFLICTING REPORTS AS TO WHETHER
UGANDAN TROOPS ACTUALLY STOOD GUARD OVER THEM.
A.  I DO NOT HAVE ANY CLEAR INFORMATION ON THAT POINT,
LARS.
Q.  I WAS HOPING WE WOULD BE ABLE TO GO THROUGH A TIME
SEQUENCE HERE IN ANSWER TO MY ORIGINAL QUESTION.  THE
UNITED STATES WAS NOTIFIED, YOU SAY, ABOUT 6:00 P.M.
SATURDAY EVENING.  WHAT DID THE UNITED STATES DO?
A.  I HAVE NO INFORMATION ON WHAT WE DID.  WE WERE PAS-
SIVE IN THE ENTIRE AFFAIR,  AND I DO NOT KNOW WHAT WE
WOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED UPON TO DO OTHER THAN TO RECEIVE
FURTHER INFORMATION.
OF COURSE WE WERE INTERESTED IN IT; IT WAS AN EVENT OF
INTERNATIONAL SIGNIFICANCE, AND, AS SUCH, WE FOLLOWED IT
ONCE WE WERE AWARE OF ITS TAKING PLACE.
Q.  I WOULD LIKE TO PURSUE THIS, IF I MAY.  DID THE UNITED
STATES INTERCEDE WITH KENYA IN ANY WAY?
A.  I HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF ANY INTERCESSION.
Q.  COULD YOU INQUIRE, PLEASE?
A.  WHAT IS YOUR QUESTION PRECISELY, MURREY?
Q.  MY QUESTION IS, DID THE UNITED STATES INTERCEDE WITH
KENYA IN ANY WAY TO FACILITATE THE EXIT OR THE REFUELING
OR ANY OTHER ACTIVITIES CONCERNED WITH THE ESCAPE ROUTE
OF THE ISRAELI COMMANDO PARTY?
A.  I THINK I HAVE ALREADY SAID, MURREY, THAT WE HAD NO
PRIOR KNOWLEDGE AND NO ROLE WHATSOEVER IN THIS AFFAIR, AND,
AS SUCH, I THINK IT FAIR TO SAY THAT WE WOULD NOT HAVE
INTERCEDED.
Q.  ARE YOU DECLINING TO TAKE MY QUESTION?
A.  NO, I AM NOT DECLINING TO TAKE YOUR QUESTION, BUT AS
WE HAVE STATED OVER THE WEEKEND IN ANSWER TO SIMILAR
QUESTIONS, THE UNITED STATES PLAYED NO ROLE WHATSOEVER
IN THIS INCIDENT.
Q.  WELL, WILL YOU TAKE THE QUESTION, PLEASE?
A.  I AM ALREADY GIVING YOU AN ANSWER.  I WILL BE
DELIGHTED TO TAKE THE QUESTION AS YOU POSED IT, BUT I AM
TRYING TO GIVE YOU AN ANSWER WHICH I THINK IS RESPONSIVE.
Q.  ALL RIGHT, LET ME PURSUE MY LINE OF QUESTIONING IF I
MAY.  WHAT WAS THE FIRST ACTION TAKEN BY THE UNITED
STATES?
A.  THE FIRST ACTION TAKEN WAS THE SECRETARY OF STATE
RECEIVING THE INFORMATION AROUND 6:00 P.M. SATURDAY
EVENING.
Q.  WHAT DID HE DO?
A.  I DO NOT KNOW.
Q.  WOULD YOU ATTEMPT TO FIND OUT, PLEASE?
A.  HE LISTENED.
Q.  WOULD YOU ATTEMPT TO FIND OUT WHAT ACTION WAS TAKEN
BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE WHEN HE RECEIVED NOTICE?
A.  I WILL ATTEMPT TO FIND OUT.
Q.  WAS THIS NOTICE FROM THE ISRAELIS?
A.  YES.
Q.  AT WHAT TIME DID THE UNITED STATES ISSUE ITS
STATEMENT?
A.  I  BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT SENT A LETTER TO MR. RABIN
ON JULY 4.  I DO NOT HAVE THE PRECISE TIME.  YOU MIGHT
ASK THE WHITE HOUSE.  THAT IS THE FOLLOWING DAY, SUNDAY,
JULY 4.
Q.  THERE IS NO FURTHER ACTION THAT YOU KNOW OF THAT WAS
TAKEN BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE?  HE SIMPLY RECEIVED THE
INFORMATION, AND THAT IS THE EXTENT OF YOUR KNOWLEDGE?
A.  THAT IS CORRECT.
Q.  A FOOTNOTE AT THIS POINT.  CAN YOU GIVE US SOME IDEA
OF HOW DETAILED A REPORT THE SECRETARY WAS GIVEN?
A.  I DO NOW KNOW.  I HAVE NO IDEA.
Q.  DO YOU, FOR EXAMPLE, KNOW WHAT ROUTE THE ISRAELI
PARTY TOOK --
A.  I DO NOT .
Q. -- ON THE WAY IN.
A.  ABSOLUTELY NOT.
Q.  YOU CAN'T TELL US THAT?
A.  NO.
Q.  WHO TOLD HIM, AND WHERE WAS IT?
A.  I UNDERSTAND THE ISRAELI AMBASSADOR CALLED THE
SECRETARY.
Q.  CALLED OR CALLED ON?
A.  CALLED, TELEPHONED.  THE SECRETARY WAS IN NEW YORK
AT THE TIME.
Q.  WAS THERE AN OP CENTER SET UP HERE IN THE COURSE OF
THIS INCIDENT?
A.  NO, AS FAR AS I KNOW, THERE WAS NO WORKING GROUP SET
UP.  I CAN CHECK ON THAT POINT FOR YOU, HOWEVER.
Q.  NOW THAT THE OPERATION IS OVER, CAN YOU TELL US WHAT
ACTIVITIES WERE ENGAGED IN BY THE STATE DEPARTMENT TER-
RORISM OFFICE?
A.  YOU MEAN THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE AFFAIR OF THE HIJACKING
OF THE AIR FRANCE AIRCRAFT WHICH BEGAN EARLIER IN THE
WEEK?
Q.  YES, PLEASE.
A.  I CANNOT GIVE YOU A DETAILED RUNDOWN ON THAT, BUT I
CAN CERTAINLY GET A DESCRIPTION OF WHAT THE OFFICE OF THE
SPECIAL ASSISTANT FOR COMBATING TERRORISM DID DURING THE
WEEK, IF YOU WOULD LIKE.
Q.  YES, I WOULD APPRECIATE THAT.
A.  THE UPDATES, THE INFORMATION THAT WE PROVIDED YOU DUR-
ING THE WEEK ON THIS MATTER WAS PROVIDED BY THAT OFFICE.
I THINK SOME OF YOU HAVE ALREADY CALLED MR. FEAREY'S OFFICE
DURING THE WEEK AND GOT WHAT INFORMATION WAS AVAILABLE.
Q.  I DIDN'T, BECAUSE, QUITE FRANKLY, MY RECOLLECTION WAS
THAT MR. FUNSETH ASKED FORBEARANCE OF THE PRESS IN RESPOND-
ING TO QUESTIONS DURING THAT PERIOD BECAUSE OF THE SEN-
SITIVITY OF THE OPERATION.
A.  YES, THERE WAS A LIMIT TO WHAT COULD BE SAID DURING
THAT VERY SENSITIVE PERIOD.
Q.  FINE.  NOW THAT THE OPERATION IS OVER, I WOULD HOPE
THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET A RECONSTRUCTION OF THE
EXTENT OF ACTIVITIES UNDERTAKEN BY THE OFFICE OF TERRORISM.
A.  I WILL BE GLAD TO ASK THAT OFFICE FOR A RECONSTRUCTION.
Q.  PICKING UP MURREY'S POINT, WAS THERE ANY POINT WHERE
THE US GOVERNMENT MADE AN APPROACH TO AMIN ASKING HIM TO
INTERCEDE ON BEHALF OF FREEING THE HOSTAGES?  OR DID WE
WATCH THIS AND DO NOTHING AND SAY NOTHING?
A.  I THINK YOU ARE RAISING TWO DIFFERENT THINGS.  I AM
NOT SURE WHETHER OR NOT ANY APPROACH WAS MADE BY THE US
GOVERNMENT DIRECTLY TO AMIN.  I WILL CHECK AND FIND OUT
FOR YOU RIGHT AFTER LUNCH.
Q.  WHAT ABOUT INDIRECTLY, FRED, THROUGH THE GERMAN
GOVERNMENT?
A.  YES, THERE WERE INDIRECT APPROACHES MADE, AS YOU KNOW,
BUT AS I TOOK BERNIE'S QUESTION, HE MEANT A DIRECT AP-
PROACH.  NOW, INDIRECTLY, AS WE SAID LAST WEEK, OUR POSI-
TION WAS MADE KNOWN BY THE FRG GOVERNMENT IN UGANDA, WHICH
REPRESENTS OUR INTERESTS THERE.  BUT I TOOK BERNIE'S QUES-
TION TO MEAN A DIRECT APPROACH, AND I WILL TRY TO FIND OUT
WHETHER OR NOT ANY WAS MADE.
Q.  WHAT IS THE POSITION OF THE UNITED STATES LEGALLY IN
THIS MATTER?  THE UNITED STATES DELIVERED A MESSAGE OF CON-
GRATULATIONS TO ISRAEL.  COULD YOU AMPLIFY OUR JURIDICAL
RATIONALIZATION?
A.  I THINK THE PRESIDENT'S STATEMENT CONTAINED IN THE
LETTER TO MR. RABIN SPEAKS FOR ITSELF.  I WOULD ONLY ADD
THAT INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM, AS A PHENOMENON, IS A
SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCE OF OUR MODERN AGE.  AND I WOULD POINT
OUT THAT FOR YEARS, THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN CALLING ON
THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO TAKE SPECIAL MEASURES TO
COMBAT IT.  AND I WILL JUST REFER YOU TO WHAT THE PRESI-
DENT HAS SAID ON THE MATTER, EXPRESSING HIS SATISFACTION
THAT THE PASSENGERS OF THE HIJACKED AIRCRAFT WERE SAVED.
Q.  WHAT I AM ASKING IS SOMETHING THAT GOES BEYOND THAT.
IT IS IN RELATION TO THE CHARGE MADE BY PRESIDENT AMIN
THAT THIS WAS AN ACT OF AGGRESSION.
A.  I AM NOT GOING TO HAVE ANY FURTHER COMMENT ON THE
MATTER, MURREY, EXCEPT TO REFER YOU TO THE ONE PRESIDENTIAL
STATEMENT THAT HAS BEEN MADE ALREADY.
Q.  YOU DON'T HAVE ANY FURTHER AMPLIFICATION FROM THE
STATE DEPARTMENT LEGAL OFFICE AS TO THEIR INTERNATIONAL
LEGAL INTERPRETATIONS?
A.  I DO NOT.
Q.  IN KEEPING WITH THE US POLICY OF NOT GIVING IN TO
RANSOM DEMANDS, DID THE UNITED STATES HAVE ANY COMMUNICA-
TION WITH ISRAEL BEFOREHAND, URGING THEM NOT TO GIVE IN?
A.  I AM NOT PRIVY TO WHETHER OR NOT SUCH COMMUNICATIONS
WERE EXCHANGED WITH THE ISRAELIS, BUT I WOULD POINT OUT,
AS WE HAVE SAID ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS, THAT WE DO NOT
FORMALLY GO INTO THE CONTENTS OF OUR DIPLOMATIC COM-
MUNICATIONS.
IN ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION, I AM NOT PRIVY TO THE EXISTENCE
OF ANY SUCH COMMUNICATION ON THAT SUBJECT.
Q.  FRED, I THINK YOU ARE PROBABLY NOT PREPARED TO
ANSWER THIS QUESTION, BUT IN VIEW OF THE SECRETARY'S
REPEATED SPEECHES ABOUT THE NEED FOR INTERNATIONAL ORDER
AND INTERNATIONAL LAW, COULD YOU TAKE THE QUESTION AS
TO WHETHER UGANDAN TERRITORIAL SOVEREIGNTY WAS VIOLATED
IN THIS RAID, WHETHER SUCH A VIOLATION, IF IT OCCURRED,
WAS JUSTIFIED BY THE CIRCUMSTANCES, OR WHAT OUR VIEW IS AS
TO THE ACT COMMITTED BY THE ISRAELIS; WHETHER IT CON-
STITUTED AN ACT OF AGGRESSION, VIOLATION OF SOVEREIGNTY,
JUSTIFIABLE OR NOT?
A.  I CAN CERTAINLY TAKE THE QUESTION, BUT I MUST COME
BACK TO WHAT YOU HAVE JUST SAID, NAMELY, OUR OFT-STATED
POSITION IS THAT, FOR YEARS, WE HAVE ARGUED IN THE INTER-
NATIONAL COMMUNITY FOR EFFECTIVE MEASURES TO COMBAT JUST
THIS KIND OF THING.  AND I WILL TRY TO GET YOU AN ANSWER
TO THE SPECIFIC QUESTION THAT YOU POSE.
Q.  I DON'T WANT TO BE CANTANKEROUS ABOUT THIS POINT, BUT
SIMPLY TO PURSUE THE SAME POINT THAT LARS MADE, THE LOGIC
OF THE POSITION THAT YOU SET OUT WOULD RAISE THE IMPLICA-
TION THAT THE UNITED STATES BELIEVES THAT THIS KIND OF
ACTION CAN BE REPEATED BY ANYONE ELSE, ANY OTHER COUNTRY,
UNDER SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF INEFFECTIVENESS OF THE INTER-
NATIONAL COMMUNITY TO COMBAT INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.  IS
THAT THE UNITED STATES PREMISE?
A.  I AM NOT GOING TO OFFER A JUDGMENT ON THAT.  IT SEEMS
TO ME YOU ARE THE ONE MAKING THE PREMISE, MURREY, AND I
WOULD NOT WISH TO BE PUT IN A POSITION OF HAVING TO CHOOSE
A YES OR NO ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION.
Q.  IS THERE AN ASSESSMENT IN THIS BUILDING OF THE EXTENT
TO WHICH THE UGANDAN GOVERNMENT COOPERATED WITH THE
TERRORISTS IN THIS INCIDENT, AS HAS CLEARLY BEEN ALLEGED
IN STATEMENTS FROM TEL AVIV?
A.  I DO NOT KNOW IF THERE IS A DEFINITIVE ASSESSMENT ON
THAT PARTICULAR POINT.
Q.  IS THERE AN OPINION?
A.  THERE ARE NO DOUBT OPINIONS AND SOME INFORMATION ON
THIS SUBJECT, BUT I AM NOT AWARE OF ANY DEFINITIVE
ASSESSMENT.  IT IS POSSIBLE THAT IT IS SOMEWHAT TOO EARLY
TO COME TO ANY KIND OF DEFINITIVE CONCLUSION ON IT.
Q.  CAN YOU TELL US WHAT THE THINKING IS?
A.  I REALLY CANNOT.
Q.  WAS ANY MESSAGE OF CONDOLENCE SENT TO THE UGANDAN
GOVERNMENT BECUASE OF THE DEATH OF SOME UGANDAN SOLDIERS
IN THE INCIDENT?
A.  I DO NOT KNOW.  I DO NOT KNOW OF ANY MESSAGE.
Q.  DO WE REGARD THOSE SOLDIERS WHO WERE KILLED AN IN-
NOCENT BYSTANDERS CAUGHT IN A FIREFIGHT, OR AIDERS AND
ABETTORS OF THE TERRORISTS, AND WHY HAVE WE NOT PUBLICIZED
ANY MESSAGE REGRETTING THEIR DEATHS?
A.  WE REGRET THE DEATH OF ANY INNOCENT BYSTANDERS IN AN
AFFAIR SUCH AS THIS.  HOWEVER, I MUST COME BACK TO THE
POINT THAT THE UNITED STATES WAS NOT INVOLVED IN WHAT
HAPPENED IN ENTEBBE.  WE HAD INNOCENT AMERICAN CITIZENS ON
BOARD AND WE OBVIOUSLY WERE VERY CONCERNED.  IN TERMS OF
EXPRESSING REGRET, WE HAD NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE DEATHS
OF THOSE TWENTY UGANDAN SOLDIERS, REGRETTABLE AS THOSE
DEATHS MAY BE.  BUT WE HAVE NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS
OCCURENCE.
Q.  IT WOULD APPEAR THAT BUT FOR THE SUPPLY OF THE THREE
C-130'S, THIS RAID MIGHT NOT HAVE TAKEN PLACE, AND THOSE
PLANES WERE SUPPLIED BY THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT.
SO I AM HAVING TROUBLE UNDERSTANDING HOW THE UNITED STATES
PLAYED NO ROLE IN IT.
A.  THE UNITED STATES SUPPLIES --
Q.  I MEAN, HAS NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE DEATH OF THOSE
UGANDANS.
A.  THE UNITED STATES WAS NOT FLYING THOSE AIRPLANES.
THE UNITED STATES HAS SUPPLIED C-130 AIRCRAFT, OR SIMILAR
AIRCRAFT, TO MANY COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD.  I WILL JUST
LEAVE IT AT THAT.
Q.  WHO, IN THE BUILDING, IS CHARGED WITH DETERMINING
WHETHER OR NOT ARMS SUPPLIED SOLELY FOR SELF-DEFENSE PUR-
POSES HAVE BEEN USED IN VIOLATION OF THE TERMS OF THOSE
ARMS SUPPLIERS?
A.  THE ULTIMATE RESPONSIBLE AUTHORITY IN THIS BUILDING
IS THE SECRETARY OF STATE.
Q.  IS HE THE RESPONSIBLE AUTHORITY WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT,
OR DOES THE PRESIDENT MAKE THE FINAL DECISION?
A.  I THINK IN SUCH A CASE IT MIGHT GO HIGHER THAN THE
SECRETARY OF STATE.  I AM NOT SUFFICIENTLY WELL INFORMED
ON THE PROCEDURE ON THIS, HOWEVER, TO GIVE YOU A FULL
REPLY.
Q.  WELL, AS A POINT OF CLARIFICATION, I WOULD LIKE TO
KNOW IF THERE IS A RESTRICTION ON THE USE OF C-130'S, AND
IF IN FACT THAT RESTRICTION WOULD APPLY ALSO TO THE C-130'S
RECENTLY SUPPLIED TO THE EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENT.
A.  AS I SAID AT THE BEGINNING, THIS IS A COMPLICATED
MATTER.  THERE WOULD BE QUESTION ON JUDGMENT INVOLVED.
AS I HAVE JUST SAID, THE ULTIMATE JUDGMENT IN THIS BUILD-
ING WOULD BE THAT OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE.
Q.  NO, I WAS ASKING A FACTUAL QUESTION; I WAS NOT ASKING
A JUDGMENTAL QUESTION.  THE FACTUAL QUESTION WAS:  ARE
THERE ARE RESTRICTIONS THAT WERE PLACED, FOR EXAMPLE, ON
THE RECENT SALE OF C-130'S TO EGYPT?  ARE THERE REALLY--
I DON'T KNOW THE FACTS.  THAT IS WHAT I WANT TO FIND
OUT.
A.  I DO NOT KNOW. YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THE RECENT SALE
OF C-130'S TO EGYPT?
Q.  YES, I AM.
A.  I DO NOT KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT, BUT I WILL FIND OUT
FOR YOU.
Q.  FRED, IS THE US GOVERNMENT, THROUGH ANY OF ITS
AGENCIES, PICKING UP ANY INFORMATION OF THREATS BY THE
PALESTINIANS BY WAY OF RETALIATION? IN OTHER WORDS, ARE
YOU GETTING AHYTHING THROUGH FBIS OR INTELLIGENCE SOURCES,
OR WHATEVER, THAT YOU HAVE PICKED UP,(A), AND (B), IF YOU
HAVE, HAVE YOU RELAYED IT TO ISRAEL AND TO ANYONE ELSE?
A.  I AM NOT AWARE OF ANY ON FBIS, BUT WE CAN CERTAINLY
CHECK THE RECENT RECORDS.  YOU SAY RETALIATION FOR THIS
PARTICULAR--
Q.  YES.
A.  I AM NOT AWARE OF ANY AT THIS TIME.
Q.  COULD YOU TAKE THAT ONE?
A.  YES.
Q.  EARLIER AT THIS BRIEFING, THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE,
THROUGH ITS SPOKESMAN, INDICATED THE UNITED STATES
PLAYED NO ROLE IN THIS INCIDENT.  DOES THAT INCLUDE
THE PLANNING AND PREPARATION OF THE RAID?
A.  THAT IS CORRECT.
Q.  DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING MORE ON THE SECRETARY'S FOREIGN
TRAVEL?
A.  NOTHING BEYOND WHAT WE BRIEFED YOU ON LAST WEEK--
NAMELY, A POSSIBLE TRIP AROUND THE FIRST WEEK OF AUGUST--
BUT THAT IS STILL UP IN THE AIR.  NO FIRM DATES YET SET.
Q.  IS IT THE IRAN TRIP?
A.  YES.
Q.  DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING IN THE SPECULATIVE GAZETTEER?
WHAT ELSE IS ADDED?
A.  THAT IS IT FOR THE MOMENT.   ROBINSON

HEREIN FOLLOWS COMPLETE TEXT OF TANGOV STATEMENT AS CARRIED IN
"DAILY NEWS" OF JULY 6, 1976.
BEGIN TEXT:
1.  "THE GOVERNMENT OF UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA HAS BEEN SHOCKED
BY THE RECKLESS AND LAWLESS ACTION TAKEN BY THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT
USING ITS ARMED FORCES TO INVADE THE REPUBLIC OF UGANDA ON THE
DECLARED GROUNDS OF RESCUING THE HOSTAGES FROM THE HIJACKERS.
2.  "THIS ACTION CARRIED OUT AT ENTEBBE AIRPORT, UGANDA IN THE EARLY
HOURS OF JULY 4 CONSTITUTES A BLATANT VIOLATION OF THE SOVEREIGNTY
AND TERRITORIAL INTERGRITY OF AN AFRICAN STATE.  IT IS IN FACT
NOTHING SHORT OF AN ACT OF AGGRESSION AGAINST A MEMBER OF THE OAU
AND THE UN.
3.  "THE ISRAELI AUTHORITIES HAVE ATTEMPTED TO JUSTIFY THEIR ACTION
FOR
THAT GRAVE VIOLATION OF INTERNATIONAL LAW AND THE CHARTER OF THE
UNITED NATIONS, AS BEING MOTIVATED BY HUMANITARIAN CONSIDERATIONS
NAMELY THE RELEASE OF THE HOSTAGES FROM THEIR HIJACKERS.
4.  "BUT SUCH JUSTIFICATIONS ARE HOLLOW AND WITHOUT FOUNDATION
WHATSOEVER, THROUGH THIS ACTION THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT DOES NOT
ONLY BEAR FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE DEATH OF SO MANY UGANDAN
CITIZENS, IT IS ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATH OF SOME OF THE VERY
HOSTAGES IT SOUGHT TO SAVE.
5.  "THUS THIS ACT OF PIRACY DEMONSTRATES ISRAEL'S CALLOUS DISREGARD
FOR HUMAN LIFE AND PARTICULARLY THE LIVES OF SO MANY AFRICANS WHO
FELL UNDER THE BULLETS OF THE INVADING  ISRAELIS.
6.  "THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA CONDEMNS
THIS RECKLESS AND UNWARRANTED ISRAELI ACTION.  IT CONSIDERS
SUCH A VIOLATION OF THE SOVEREIGNTY OF AN AFRICAN STATE BY ISRAEL
AS A MATTER OF GRAVE CONCERN TO THE ENTIRE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
AND MORE PARTICULARLY TO THE OAU MEMBER STATES.  IN EXPRESSING ITS
OUT RAGE AGAINST THE ISRAELI INVASION OF UGANDA THE GOVERNMENT
IS NOT IN ANY WAY INSENSITIVE TO THE PLIGHT OF THE HOSTAGES - ISRAELI
S
AS WELL AS OTHERS WHO WERE TAKEN BY THE HIJACKERS.  IN FACT, TANZANIA
HAS FOLLOWED THEIR PREDICAMENT WITH GREAT CONCERN AND SYMPATHY.
7.  "WE HAVE ALWAYS MAINTAINED THAT SUCH ENDANGERING OF HUMAN LIFE
IS SOMETHING THAT MUST BE AVOIDED AND THAT NO EFFORTS BE SPARED TO
AVOID RECURRENCE OF INCIDENTS OF THIS NATURE.  IN THE PARTICULAR
CASE OF THE HIJACKED PLANE TO ENTEBBE, WE WERE CONCERNED AT THE
LIVES OF ALL HOSTAGES AND HAD HOPED THAT EVERYTHING WOULD BE DONE
SO THAT NO SINGLE LIFE IS LOST.  REGRETTABLY, ISRAEL'S IRRESPON-
SIBLE MILITARY ACTIONS HAVE FRUSTRATED OUR HOPES.
8.  "THE FLAGARANT VIOLATION OF A COUNTRY'S SOVEREIGNTY IS A MATTER
WHICH SHOULD CAUSE AN OUTRAGE TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  BUT
FOR AFRICA, ISRAEL'S ACTION HAS SERIOUS IMPLICATIONS.  THE FACT
THAT ISRAELI HAS COMMITTED THIS ACTION AGAINST AN INDEPENDENT
AFRICAN STATE SHOWS THE CONTEMPT THAT SHE HAS FOR AFRICA AND THE
AFRICAN PEOPLE.
9.  "FOR THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT ISRAELI CITIZENS HAVE FALLEN
VICTIMS OF HIJACKING AND OTHER ACTIONS.  IT HAS HAPPENED ELSEWHERE.
YET ISRAEL HAS NOT EVEN ONCE MOUNTED ANYTHING OF THIS NATURE
AGAINST THOSE COUNTRIES.  IT  IS THE CONTEMPT WHICH ISRAEL HAS
FOR THE SOVEREIGNTY OF AFRICAN STATES WHICH HAS PROMPTED HER TO
ACT IN SUCH AN ARROGANT AND LAWLESS MANNER.
AFRICA HAS TO DRAW THE NECESSARY CONCLUSIONS FROM THIS ACTION.
10.  OVER AND ABOVE THIS, THERE IS ANOTHER DIMENSION OF THE ISRAELI
OPERATIONS WHICH FREE AFRICA MUST NOT LOSE SIGHT OF.  THIS IS THE
CALLOUS AND ARBITRARY WAY AFRICA'S SOVEREIGNTY AND TERRITORIAL
INTEGRITY IS VIOLATED WHENEVER THE LIVES OF SOME WHITES ARE INVOLVED.
FOR THE ISRAELI AGGRESSION AGAINST UGAND EVOKES THE BITTER MEMORIES
OF THE MILITARY INTERVENTION IN STANLEYVILLE IN 1964.
11.  "THIS DANGEROUS PRECEDENT OF ARBITRARY VIOLATION OF AFRICA'S
SOVEREIGNTY BY THE ISRAELI AUTHORITIES MUST NOT BE TAKEN LIGHTLY.
FREE AFRICA HAS TO RIGHTLY RECOGNISE THAT THIS CHALLENGE AND
PROVOCATION AGAINST UGANDA IS IN FACT CHALLENGE AND GROSS
PROVOCATION AGAINST THE WHOLE OF AFRICA.  AFRICA MUST TAKE ALL
THE NECESSARY MEASURES AND PRECAUTIONS AGAINST A REPETITION OF
THIS HEINOUS CRIME FROM ANY QUARTER."  END TEXT

 * 170768 1976PORTL00592 0.007120577 | 1976-07-06 | PORT LOUIS | STATE | OAU SUMMIT CLOSES
SUMMARY: 13TH ORDINARY OAU SUMMIT ENDED IN THE EARLY HOURS OF
JULY 6. PRESS AND GENERAL PUBLIC WERE TWICE CLEARED FROM THE
CONFERENCE HALL IN ORDER TO PERMIT SUMMIT TO MEET IN CLOSED SESSION.
FINAL SESSION HEARD SPEECHES FROM NEWLY ARRIVED SUDAN PRESIDENT
NIMEIRI CONDEMNING LIBYAN INVOLVEMENT IN THE KHARTOUM COUP
ATTEMPT AND OTHER UNDISCLOSED BUSINESS. IN OPEN SESSION, MAURITIAN
PRIME MINISTER RAMGOOLAM, GABONESE PRESIDENT BONGO, GAMBIAN
PRIME MINISTER JAWARA AND EGYPTIAN VICE PRESIDENT MUBARAK SPOKE.
SPEAKERS WERE UNANIMOUS IN THEIR CONDEMNATION OF "ISRAELI
AGGRESSION" IN UGANDA AND SOUTH AFRICA RACISM, AND IN THEIR
BROTHERLY SUPPORT FOR PRESIDENT NIMEIRI. END SUMMARY.
1. PRIME MINISTER RAMGOOLAM CRITICIZED AT GREAT LENGTH THE
ISRAELI COMMANDO OPERATION IN UGANDA. HE REPORTED THAT HE
HAD SENT A MESSAGE OF CONDOLENCE TO UGANDAN PRESIDENT AMIN
BECAUSE OF THE LOSS OF LIFE IN UGANDA. RAMGOOLAM CALLED UPON
HIS "BROTHERS IN NORTH AFRICA" TO RESOLVE DIFFERENCES OVER
THE WESTERN SAHARA.
2. PRESIDENT BONGO, ONE OF THE FEW REMAINING CHIEFS OF STATE
HERE, THANKED RAMGOOLAM AND THE MAURITIAN PEOPLE FOR THEIR
HOSPITALITY. HE SAID NEVER SINCE THE OAU WAS FOUNDED HAS A
SUMMIT COMPLETED AS MUCH WORK "AND WORK WELL DONE". COMMENT:
TIRED AND FRUSTRATED DELEGATES ALLOWED THEMSELVES AUDIBLE
SNICKERS. END COMMENT.
3. PRIME MINISTER JAWARA AGREED THAT THIS SUMMIT HAD BEEN ONE
OF THE "MOST EVENTFUL AND DIFFICULT MEETINGS" OF THE OAU. IT
HAD BEGUN, HE SAID, UNDER THE CLOUD OF SOWETO, HAD BEEN BUFFETED
BY NAKED ISRAELI AGGRESSION AGAINST UGANDA AND THE FOILED COUP
ATTEMPT IN SUDAN. TURNING TO THE SUBJECT OF SOUTH AFRICA
LIBERATION, JAWARA STATED "WE HAVE THE OPEN SUPPORT OF SOCIALIST
COUNTRIES" IN THE LIBERATION STRUGGLE. HE EXPRESSED THE HOPE
THAT WESTERN DEMOCRACIES WILL BE TRUE TO THEIR PRINCIPLES AND NOW
ACTIVELY SUPPORT SOUTHERN AFRICAN LIBERATION MOVEMENTS. IN THIS
REGARD, HE RECALLED TO THE SUMMIT ASSEMBLY THAT THIS WAS THE
BICENTENNIAL OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION AND ASKED US AND OTHER
WESTERN COUNTRIES TO BE TRUE TO THE PRINCIPLES OF THAT REVOLUTION.
(OAU SPOKESMAN PETER ONU HAD PREVIOUSLY NOTED MESSAGES OF
CONGRATULATION TO THE OAU FROM PRESIDENT FORD AND SOVIET PRESIDENT
PODGORNY).
4. VICE PRESIDENT MUBARAK OF EGYPT CALLED UPON OAU MEMBERS TO
ESCALATE MILITANT ACTION IN SOUTH AFRICA. HE TERMED ISRAELI
"AGGRESSIONS" IN UGANDA AN ATTACK ON THE ENTIRE AFRICAN CONTINENT.
HE EXPRESSED FULL FRATERNAL SOLIDARITY WITH PRESIDENT NIMEIRI
AND PRAISED THE OAU SECRETARY GENERAL AND SECRETARIAT AND THE
GOVERNMENT OF MAURITIUS FOR THE EXCELLENT ADMINISTRATION OF THE
CONFERENCE.
5. UNESCO SECRETARY GENERAL M'BOW, WHO ARRIVED WITH PRESIDENT
NIMEIRI, SPOKE BRIEFLY TO THE CLOSING SUMMIT SESSION AS THE
HIGHEST RANKING AFRICAN IN THE UN SYSTEM.
6. EARLIER, IN CLOSED SESSION, SUDANESE PRESIDENT NIMEIRI
REPORTED ON THE KHARTOUM COUP ATTEMPT. IN DESCRIBING THE
KHARTOUM FIGHTING, NIMEIRI SAID "IT WAS QUITE EVIDENT FROM THE
START THAT THESE (ANTI-NIMEIRI) FORCES HAD BEEN HIGHLY TRAINED
AND EQUIPPED WITH MODERN WEAPONS. THE WEAPONS USED ARE CERTAINLY
NOT AVAILABLE TO THE SUDANESE ARMED FORCES NOR MOST OF THE POOR
AFRICAN COUNTRIES." HE ACCUSED THE ANTI-GOVERNMENT FORCES OF
KILLING INNOCENT CIVILIANS, INCLUDING HOSPITAL PATIENTS, IN COLD
BLOOD AND SAID THE MARKINGS ON SOPHISTICATED WEAPONS AND
VEHICLE LICENSE PLATES WERE UNMISTAKABLY FROM BENGHAZI, LIBYA.
NIMEIRI THEN SAID MANY OF THE CAPTURED MEN HAVE CONFESSED TO
HAVING BEEN TRAINED IN LIBYA AND ELSEWHERE BY LIBYAN
INSTRUCTORS AND THEY HAD BEEN EQUIPPED BY LIBYA. THIS
LIBYAN ACTION, HE SAID, MEANS THAT THAT COUNTRY MUST BE COUNTED
AMONG THE ENEMIES OF AFRICA WHO ARE BENT ON DESTROYING ITS
UNITY AND PROGRESS. NIMEIRI'S SPEECH, HOWEVER, FELL SHORT OF
CALLING FOR A CONDEMNATORY RESOLUTION AGAINST LIBYA.

ATTACK
1. AT 0658 GMT RADIO UGANDA ANNOUNCED THAT 30 ENEMY
AIRCRAFT HAVE BEEN DETECTED BY UGANDAN RADAR AND CALLED
UPON PUBLIC TO BE PREPARED TO DONATE BLOOD FOR EMERGENCY
CASES. UGANDA, SAID THE MILITARY SPOKESMAN, IS CAPABLE
OF DEFENDING HERSELF WITHOUT ASSISTANCE, ALTHOUGH SEVERAL
FRIENDLY COUNTRIES ARE PREPARED TO COME BY AIR OR OTHER-
WISE IN OUR DEFENSE. HE APPLIED TO SECURITY FORCES AND TO
EVERY MAN AND WOMAN TO BE ON THE ALERT. SHOULD ANY
UGANDAN NOTICE ANY ENEMY AIRCRAFT LANDING ANYWHERE NEAR
HIS AREA, HE SHOULD USE ANY WEAPON WITHIN HIS REACH TO
FINISH OFF SPEEDILY THE AIRCRAFT'S OCCUPANT BECAUSE THE
ENEMY HAS NO SYMPATHY. THE MILITARY SPOKESMAN FURTHER
ADVISED THE COUNTRY TO LISTEN CONSTANTLY TO THE UGANDAN
BROADCASTING CORPORATION FOR ANY DEVELOPMENTS.
2. AT 0958 GMT RADIO UGANDA AGAIN REPORTED DETECTION
OF 30 AIRCRAFT AND SAID IT WAS BELIEVED THEY WERE
ISRAELI AND AMERICAN AND WERE APPROACHING UGANDA FROM
KENYA. THE MILITARY SPOKESMAN ADVISED PUBLIC NOT TO
PANIC, BUT TO KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON ANY SUSPECT WESTERN

OF SUCH PEOPLE. ALL MEDICAL SERVICES IN UGANDA SHOULD

1.  MFA DEPUTY DIRECTOR GENERAL EVRON CALLED DCM EARLY JULY 4
(AMBASSADOR WAS EN TOUTE TO DEDICATION OF BICENTENNIAL NATIONAL
PARK) AND GAVE FOLLOWING FIRST DETAILS OF LAST NIGHT'S DRAMATIC
RESCUE OPERATION BY IDF FORCES AT ENTEBBE AIRPORT.  HE SAID
AMBASSADORS OF SEVERAL "FRIENDLY COUNTRIES" WERE BEING CALLED
IN THIS MORNING TO BE GIVEN THESE DETAILS.
2.  EVRON BEGAN BY SAYING THAT, WHILE HE KNEW WE WERE WELL AWARE
OF WHAT HAD BEEN GOING ON, HE WANTED TO EXPLAIN WHY THE GOI FELT
IT HAD HAD TO OPERATE AS IT DID.  FIRST, THEY HAD COME TO THE
CONCLUSION THAT IT WAS PROBABLY GOING TO BE IMPOSSIBLE TO REACH
AGREEMENT WITH THE HIJACKERS.  SECOND, THEY HAD TO TAKE INTO AC-
COUNT A "PROPER ESTIMATE" OF THE FRENCH INTERLOCUTORY ROLE.  THIRD,
THERE WAS THE OBVIOUS FACT THAT AMIN WAS WORKING HAND-IN-GLOVE
WITH THE HIJACKERS.  FOURTH, DEMANDS
WERE BEING MADE UPON ISRAEL TO PRESSURE OTHER COUNTRIES TO RE-
LEASE PRISONERS THEY WERE HOLDING, ALTHOUGH ONLY ISRAELIS WERE
BEING HELD HOSTAGE (OVERLOOKING, OF COURSE, THE AIR CREW).  FIFTH,
IF ISRAEL HAD GIVEN IN TO THE HIJACKERS DEMANDS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
ANOTHER BLOW AGAINST INTERNATIONAL SECURITY, AND A REWARD FOR IN-
TERNATIONAL BLACKMAIL.
3.  GIVEN THESE CIECUMSTANCES, ISRAEL HAD CONCLUDED THAT IT HAD TO
ACT.  THERE WAS NO INTENTION TO INTERFERE WITH OR HARM THE IN-
TERESTS OF ANY OTHER COUNTRY, EVRON STRESSED.  THE ONLY OBJECTIVE
OF THE ISRAELI TASK FORCE WAS TO SECURE THE SAFETY OF ISRAELI CIT-
IZENS.  THE AIR CREW HAD BEEN OFFERED THE OPTION OF DEPARTING WITH
THE ISRAELI TASK FORCE OR OF STAYING IN UGANDA.  THEY CHOSE TO
DEPART.
4.  EVRON SAID THAT TWO OF THE HOSTAGES WERE KILLED DURING THE FIGHT
AND THERE WERE SEVERAL CASUALTIES AMONG THE ISRAELI TASK FORCE.
NO PRISONERS WERE TAKEN AND HE BELIEVED THAT ALL THE HIJACKERS HAD
BEEN KILLED.  THERE WERE ALSO SOME UGANDAN CASUALTIES.  IN ALL,
HE THOUGHT THE NUMBER OF CASUALTIES WERE VERY FEW CONSIDERING THE
COMPLEXITY OF THE ENTIRE OPERATION.
5.  PRIME MINISTER RABIN WILL ADDRESS A SPECIAL SESSION OF THE
KNESSET THIS AFTERNOON.  THE MESSAGE HE RECEIVED FROM PRESIDENT
FORD DURING THE NIGHT WILL BE RELEASED AT 2 P.M. LOCAL TIME WHEN
RABIN IS SCHEDULED TO BEGIN SPEAKING.
6.  DCM ASKED ABOUT KENYAN COOPERATION.  EVRON DUCKED THIS BY
SAYING THAT HE HOPED TO GET TO US LATER ON THIS SUBJECT.  AS WE
COULD IMAGINE, HE ADDED, THE LESS SAID ABOUT THIS THE BETTER.
7.  COMMENT.  WHILE IT IS TOO EARLY TO ASSESS ALL THE MANY RAMIFI-
CATIONS OF THIS OPERATION, IT IS LIKELY TO BOOST THE DOMESTIC
STANDING
OF THE PRIME MINISTER AND HIS GOVERNMENT.  THE RESCUE OPERATION
IS PROBABLY THE GREATEST FILLIP TO ISRAELI MORALE SINCE THE YOM
KIPPUR WAR.   TOON UNQTE ROBINSON

SUMMARY:  MAJOR STRAIGHT NEWS STORIES THIS PAST WEEK
PARALLELED EDITORIAL CONCERNS:  U.S. BICENTENNIAL, LEBANESE
CRISIS, AND ISRAELI RAID IN UGANDA.  END SUMMARY.
1.  BICENTENNIAL
U.S. BICENTENNIAL-RELATED ARTICLES AND EDITORIALS VIED
WITH LEBANON, AND UGANDA AS MAJOR ITEMS OF THE WEEK.
SPECIAL BICENTENNIAL SUPPLEMENTS IN BOTH ENGLISH
LANGUAGE DAILIES (INCLUDING USIS PROVIDED MATERIALS)
WITH ENGLISH LANGUAGE DAILY ARAB NEWS EDITORIALIZING:
"A GREAT NATION IS TODAY CELEBRATING ITS BICENTENNIAL...
THE YOUNGEST AND PROBABLY STILL THE STRONGEST OF THE
SUPERPOWERS.... NEWLY INDEPENDENT CONTRIES,
AND AREAS WAITING TO OBTAIN THEIR INDEPENDENCE, ARE MUCH
FLATTERED AT THIS UNAFFECTED REACTION OF JOY BY AMERICANS
AS THEY MARK 200 YEARS OF INDEPENDENCE FROM BRITAIN.
(THEY) ARE GRATIFIED STILL MORE BY THE FACT THAT THE
FORMIDABLE U.S. WAS A COLONY ONLY TWO CENTURIES AGO AND
ITS ARMY OF LIBERATION HAD TO GO THROUGH SIMILAR...
ORDEALS BEING FACED NOW BY THE PALESTINIANS IN TEL
ZAATAR, THE MUSLIMS IN THE SOUTHERN PHILIPPINES AND THE
BLACKS IN SOUTH AFRICA."
ARABIC LANGUAGE DAILY UKA'AZ:  "WE ARABS CONGRATULATE
AMERICA ...HOPING THAT AMERICA WILL REMEMBER THE AGONY
SUFFERED BY THE AMERICAN PATRIOTS DURING THEIR STRUGGLE
TO BREAK LOOSE FROM BRITISH IMPERIALISM.  WE ALSO HOPE
THIS MEMORY WILL INDUCE AMERICA TO SUPPORT PEOPLE SEEKING
THEIR INDEPENDENCE WHETHER IN PALESTINE, SOUTH AFRICA, OR
SOMEWHERE ELSE."
2.  LEBANON
AR-RIYADH DAILY, JUNE 6:  "LEBANON IS PASSING
THROUGH A BLACK JULY ARRANGED BY CERTAIN CIRCLES A
LONG TIME AGO.... THE CONSPIRACY IS LEBANON IS LARGER
IN SIZE THAN THE ARAB LEAGUE."
3.  ISRAELI RAID IN UGANDA
AR-RIYADH DAILY 7/5:  "(THE RAID WAS ALSO AIMED AT)
DESTROYING THE OAU SINCE THE ISRAELI PLANES LANDED IN
KENYA; THEREFORE A DIVISION IS MOST LIKELY TO TAKE
PLACE IN THE OAU AND COULD LEAD TO A DEADLOCK IN THE
AFRICAN SUMMIT IN MAURITIUS."
AL-MADINA DAILY 7/5; "A FLAGRANT INFRINGEMENT OF
THE SECURITY AND SOVEREIGNITY OF AN INDEPENDENT STATE.
IT EMPHASIZES THAT THE ZIONISTS HAVE SPHERES OF
INFLUENCE IN AFRICA... (AND THAT) THESE BASES ARE AT
THE DISPOSAL OF OUR ENEMY, ON SHORT NOTICE, TO ATTACK
ANOTHER STATE."
ENGLISH LANGUAGE ARAB NEWS, 7/6:  "WORLD REACTION TO
THE ISRAELI VIOLATION OF UGANDA'S SOVEREIGNITY PROVIDES
A STRIKING EXAMPLE OF HOW THE EAST/WEST POLIARIZATION IS
GETTING DEEPER EACH PASSING DAY.... IN REMARKABLE
CONTRAST TO AFRICAN AND ASIAN UNANIMITY IN CONDEMNING
THE AGGRESSOR (ISRAEL), PRESIDENT FORD CONGRATULATED
THE ISRAELIS ON THEIR DARING EXPLOIT.... WE ARE
DISMAYED TO SEE UNSCRUPULOUS PIRATES GOING ON THE
RAMPAGE, KILLING AND DYNAMITING AT RANDOM, THEN
RECEIVING LOUD ACCLAIM FROM SOME COUNTRIES."

ON LEBANON
1. ON JULY 1 EXECUTIVE BOARD OF GENERAL UNION OF TUNISIAN
WORKERS (UGTT) ISSUED DECLARATION ON SITUATION IN LEBANON,
IN WHICH IT EXPRESSED "DEEP INDIGNATION AND CENSURE"
TOWARD THE "WAR OF EXTERMINATION" IN LEBANON. IT SAID
CIVIL WAR "AIMS STRAIGHT AT THE LIQUIDATION OF PALESTINIAN
RESISTANCE AND THE PARTITION OF LEBANON, IN ACCORDANCE
WITH A WELL-CONCEIVED ZIONIST AND IMPERIALIST PLAN HATCHED
AFTER OCTOBER 1973 WAR." UGTT ALSO ATTACKS GREAT
POWERS AND ESPECIALLY U.S. FOR EMPLOYING RIGHT OF VETO
IN OPPOSING EVERY RESOLUTION IMPLYING RECOGNITION OF
RIGHT OF PALESTINIAN PEOPLE TO HOMELAND AND STRESSES CON-
TINUING SUPPORT FOR PALESTINIAN CAUSE, A CAUSE OF "JUSTICE,
SURVIVAL AND LIBERTY." IN CLOSING ITS DECLARATION, THE UGTT
CALLED ON ARAB LEAGUE MEMBERS TO END SHEDDING OF ARAB BLOOD
AND TO UNIFY THEMSELVES IN THE FACE OF "WRETCHED INTRIGUES"
AGAINST THE ARAB PEOPLE. UGTT ALSO CALLED ON GREAT POWERS
TO CEASE USE OF VETO IN UN TO KILL "INITIATIVES TOWARD
PEACE."
2. EMBASSY OFFICER CALLED ON UGTT SECRETARY GENERAL
HABIB ACHOUR SHORTLY AFTER PUBLICATION OF JULY 1 DECLARA-
TION. ACHOUR WAS DEEPLY DISTRESSED BY SITUATION IN
LEBANON AND CONCERNED OVER DAMAGE CIVIL WAR HAS DONE TO
PALESTINIANS. APPARENTLY AT LOOSE ENDS OVER WHAT HE
COULD DO TO AID IN RESOLUTION OF CRISIS, HE PLACED
TELEPHONE CALL TO AFL-CIO EUROPEAN REPRESENTATIVE

 * 145857 1976NAIROB07002 0.007111771 | 1976-07-07 | NAIROBI | STATE | RENEWED KENYAN FEARS OF MILITARY ATTACK BY UGANDA
1.  PRESIDENTIAL PERMSEC KARIITHI SUMMONED ME TO HIS OFFICE
THIS AFTERNOON TO EXPRESS HIS HEIGHTENED CONCERN THAT
PRESIDENT AMIN PLANS TO ATTACK KENYA IN VERY NEAR FUTURE.
(HE HAD PREVIOUSLY EXPRESSED HIS CONCERN ON THIS SUBJECT
TO US ON JUNE 30, AS REPORTED IN REFTEL.)  KENYAN APPRE-
HENSION HAS NOW BEEN FURTHER REINFORCED BY RADIO UGANDA
ANNOUNCEMENT TODAY AT 0958 GMT (1258 LOCAL) THAT "30
ENEMY AIRCRAFT HAVE BEEN DETECTED BY UGANDA RADAR.  AIRCRAFT,
BELIEVED TO BE ISRAELI AND AMERICAN, WERE APPROACHING
UGANDA FROM KENYA."  UGANDA RADIO FURTHER ADVISED PUBLIC
"TO BE PREPARED TO DONATE BLOOD FOR EMERGENCY CASES", AND
ANNOUNCED THAT ALL MEDICAL SERVICES IN UGANDA SHOULD BE
ON STANDBY.
2.  KARIITHI SAID THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, COMING ON HEELS OF
MESSAGE TO PRESIDENT KENYATTA FROM AMIN LAST NIGHT DIRECTLY
ACCUSING KENYATTA OF HAVING FACILITATED ISRAELI HIJACK
RESCUE, IS TANTAMOUNT TO PUTTING UGANDA ON WAR FOOTING.
ALTHOUGH MEETING OF UGANDAN DEFENSE COUNCIL ON MONDAY HAD
VOTED 80 PERCENT AGAINST ATTACKING KENYA (AMIN WAS IN
MINORITY), AMIN IS APPARENTLY TRYING TO WIN OVER ARMY
TO SUPPORT HIM IN WAR ON KENYA, ACCORDING TO KARIITHI.
3.  EVEN MORE ALARMING TO GOK IS INTELLIGENCE REPORT THAT
TWO AIRCRAFT (BELIEVED TO BE EITHER LIBYAN OR SOVIET) LANDED
AT ENTEBBE AIRPORT AT 1000 LOCAL TODAY CARRYING AIRCRAFT
SPARES AND SOVIET TECHNICIANS.  KENYANS BELIEVE THAT THESE
SPARES AND TECHNICIANS WILL BE USED TO MAKE SOVIET-BUILT
UGANDA AIR FORCE PLANES LOCATED AT GULU, WHICH HAD BEEN
OUT OF COMMISSION FOR LACK OF PARTS, OPERABLE AGAIN.
KARIITHI BELIEVES ARRIVAL OF THIS ASSISTANCE MAY BE
IMPORTANT FACTOR IN ENCOURAGING AMIN'S BELLICOSITY.
4.  WHEN I ASKED WHETHER THERE WAS ANY NEW EVIDENCE OF
PLANS FOR UGANDAN GROUND ATTACK AGAINST KENYA, KARIITHI
REPLIED IN NEGATIVE, BUT MENTIONED THAT ONE UGANDAN
BATTALION LOCATED NEAR MBALE, ABOUT 30 MILES FROM KENYA
BORDER, HAD BEEN ON FULL ALERT AS OF TWO DAYS AGO.  I
ALSO ASKED WHETHER KENYA HAD RECENTLY CONSULTED WITH
TANZANIA ON THIS SITUATION AND WAS ALSO GIVEN NEGATIVE
REPLY.  KARIITHI FELT THAT, DESPITE NYERERE'S DISLIKE FOR
AMIN, KENYA COULD NOT EXPECT ANY SUPPORT FROM TANZANIA IF
UGANDA WERE TO ATTACK.
5.  AS PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE, KENYA DELAYING DELIVERY OF
MILITARY EQUIPMENT BELONGING TO UGANDA NOW IN PORT OF
MOMBASA.  IN ADDITION, KARIITHI SAID THAT GOK HAS INSTRUCTED
RAILROADS TO BE "A LITTLE SLOW" IN DELIVERING OIL TO
UGANDA, BUT WILL NOT COMPLETELY SHUT OFF OIL UNLESS WAR
SITUATION DEVELOPS.  PERMSEC OF DEFENSE KIERINI, WHO WAS
ALSO PRESENT AT MEETING, SAID THAT KENYA AREMED FORCES HAVE
AGAIN BEEN PLACED ON ALERT. (THEY HAD BEEN ON FULL ALERT
ON SUNDAY AND MONDAY AFTER ISRAELI RESCUE OPERATION, BUT
HAD BEEN TAKEN OFF ALERT ON TUESDAY).
5.  KARIITHI SAID THAT FOREIGN MINISTER WAIYAKI IS LEAVING
FOR NEW YORK TONIGHT FOR SECURITY COUNCIL MEETING ON
ISRAELI RESCUE OPERATION.  USUN WILL PRESUMABLY WANT TO
ESTABLISH CONTACT WITH HIM ASAP.

 * 252501 1976STATE167672 0.007111333 | 1976-07-07 | SECSTATE WASHDC | TEL AVIV CAIRO | MEETING WITH ROSENNE ON SINAI OIL
1.  MFA LEGAL ADVISER MEIR ROSENNE MET WITH DEPARTMENT
LEGAL ADVISER LEIGH JULY 1 TO DISCUSS LEGAL ASPECTS OF
ISRAELI OIL EXPLORATION IN SINAI AND GULF OF SUEZ.  DIS-
CUSSION TOUCHED ONLY VERY BRIEFLY AT END ON PROBLEM OF
ISRAELI HARASSMENT OF AMOCO OPERATIONS.  NEITHER SIDE
PRESENTED FORMAL LEGAL MEMORANDA TO THE OTHER.  DIS-
CUSSION, WHILE INCONCLUSIVE, REVEALED SERIOUS WEAKNESSES
IN ISRAELI CASE IN OPINION OF LEGAL ADVISER'S OFFICE.
2.  DEPUTY LEGAL ADVISER ALDRICH MADE PRINCIPAL PRESENTA-
TION FOR US SIDE.  US POSITION BASED PRIMARILY ON ARTICLE
55 OF HAGUE REGULATION OF 1907, WHICH REGULATES, INTER
ALIA, OCCUPYING POWER'S RIGHTS TO EXTRACT MINERAL RE-
SOURCES.  IN US VIEW, ARTICLE 55 PERMITS EXPLOITATION OF
EXISTING OIL WELLS BY OCCUPYING POWERS, BUT NOT EXPLOITA-
TION OF NEW WELLS.  SINCE WE MUST ASSUME THAT ISRAEL IN-
TENDS TO EXPLOIT ANY OIL DISCOVERED BY CURRENT EXPLORATION,
WE MUST OPPOSE EXPLORATION, ALTHOUGH, IN ITSELF, IT WOULD
NOT NECESSARILY BE ILLEGAL.
3.  ROSENNE, WHO NOTED HE HAD NOT FULLY PREPARED FOR THIS
MEETING, (ALTHOUGH HE READ FROM A PREPARED MEMORANDUM),
SAID THIS PROBLEM BREAKS DOWN INTO FOUR QUESTIONS:
A.  IS ISRAEL ENTITLED TO EXPLORE FOR OIL IN SINAI?
B.  CAN ISRAEL GRANT CONCESSIONS FOR THAT PURPOSE?
C.  IS ISRAEL ENTITLED TO DO THE SAME IN TERRITORIAL
WATERS IT OCCUPIES IN GULF OF SUEZ?
D.  CAN EGYPT GRANT CONCESSIONS SUBSEQUENT TO ISRAELI
OCCUPATION OF THE CONCESSION AREA?
4.  IN HIS PRESENTATION, ROSENNE SAID GOI HAS CONCLUDED:
A.  THERE IS NO DISTINCTION BETWEEN EXPLOITATION OF OLD
WELLS AND NEW WELLS; THEREFORE, ISRAEL COULD EXPLORE FOR
NEW SOURCES OF OIL, SO LONG AS IT DID NOT WASTE THE
RESOURCES;
B.  ISRAEL, AND ONLY ISRAEL, CAN LEGALLY GRANT CONCESSIONS
IN TERRITORIES IT OCCUPIES;
ANY CASE, HE THOUGHT THAT ISRAEL'S DRILLING ACTIVITIES
WERE ONLY ABOUT 4 OR 4 1/2 KM FROM THE SHORE, AND THUS
PROBABLY WITHIN THE 3-MILE LIMIT RECOGNIZED BY THE US;
D.  EGYPTIAN CONCESSIONS GRANTED AFTER 1967 ARE NOT
BINDING UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW.
5.  IN SUMMARY, ROSENNE BELIEVED ISRAEL HAD A STRONG
LEGAL CASE.
6.  ALDRICH REPEATED THAT OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE DOCTRINE
OF USUFRUCT PROHIBITED THE OPENING AND EXPLOITATION OF
NEW WELLS.  WE ALSO DISAGREED WITH ISRAEL'S VIEWS ON
ISRAELI RIGHTS OF OCCUPATION OF THE TERRITORIAL SEA AND
ABOUT RIGHTS IN THE CONTINENTALSHELF,AND BELIEVED THAT
EGYPT RETAINED RIGHT TO GRANT CONCESSIONS IN OCCUPIED
TERRITORY AFTER OCCUPATION HAD BEGUN, ALTHOUGH WE RECOG-
NIZED THAT HOLDER OF CONCESSION COULD NOT DEMAND ACCESS
DURING OCCUPATION.
7.  THERE ENSUED A TECHNICAL DISCUSSION ABOUT THE DOCTRINE
OF USUFRUCT, IN WHICH THE US NOTED THAT THE LAW WAS CLEAR
ON EXPLOITATION OF MINERAL RESOURCES -- USE OF OLD MINES
AND WELLS AT PRE-EXISTING RATES WAS A LIMITED EXCEPTION
TO THE PROHIBITION OF WASTE OF CAPITAL ASSETS.  EARLIER,
ONLY RENEWABLE RESOURCES, LIKE CROPS AND TREES COULD BE
TAKEN AND ONLY SO LONG AS CAPITAL WAS PRESERVED.  THE
EXCEPTION DID NOT EXTEND TO OPENING NEW MINES OR WELLS,
WHICH WAS PROHIBITED WASTE IN LEGAL SYSTEMS USING THE
USUFRUCTUARY CONCEPT.  THE US SIDE MADE THE ADDITIONAL
POINT THAT UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW ON BELLIGERENT OCCUPA-
TION THE OCCUPYING POWER HAD THE RIGHT TO USE PROPERTY
UNDER USUFRUCT OR ANY OTHER HEADING OF THE LAW ONLY FOR
MILITARY PURPOSES OR TO CARRY OUT ITS RESPONSIBILITIES AS
AN ADMINISTERING POWER TOWARD THE LOCAL POPULATION.  THE
US POINTED OUT THAT THERE WAS SOME AUTHORITY FOR THE
FURTHER PROPOSITION THAT SUCH PROPERTY COULD ONLY BE USED
IN OCCUPIED TERRITORY ITSELF.
8.  EACH SIDE TACITLY AGREED TO DO FURTHER WORK ON ITS
POSITION BASED ON ITS PRESENT UNDERSTANDING OF THE OTHER
SIDE'S POSITION, BUT NO TIME-TABLE WAS AGREED UPON FOR AN
EXCHANGE OF PAPERS.
9.  BEFORE ADJOURNING, LEIGH RAISED QUESTION OF HARASSMENT
OF AN AMERICAN COMPANY'S VESSELS IN THE GULF.  HE SAID
THE US VIEWS THIS MATTER SERIOUSLY AND URGED THAT ISRAEL
TREAT IT WITH SIMILAR CONCERN.  ROSENNE NOTED MR. LEIGH'S
REMARK, BUT MADE NO REPLY.
10.  FULL MEMCON BEING POUCHED.           KISSINGER

** 139473 1976MOSCOW10626 0.007110659 | 1976-07-06 | MOSCOW | STATE | POSSIBLE SC MEETING ON ISRAELI RESCUE OPERATION
WE BELIEVE THAT NOTHING WOULD BE GAINED IN APPROACHING THE SOVIETS
ON THIS MATTER.  SOVIET PRESS IN REPORTING RESCUE OPERATION
HAD ALREADY CHARACTERIZED IT AS "PIRATICAL ACT" (TASS ITEM FROM
PORT LOUIS IN JULY 5 PRAVDA), AND ALTHOUGH PRIVATE COMMENT FROM
OFFICIALS AT JULY 5 SPASO HOUSE RECEPTION WAS MORE RETICENT,
AND EVEN ADMIRING IN INDIVIDUAL INSTANCES,IT IS PRACTICAL
CERTAINTY THAT SOVIETS WILL NOT BE DISSUADED FROM ADHERING TO
ANY ANTI-ISRAELI CONSENSUS THAT CAN BE FASHIONED BY ANYTHING
WE CAN SAY.

1.  SSM DIRECTOGUCONTOS, ACCOMPANIED BY SFM CHIEF THORNE, "E"
SYSTEMS CHAIRMAN DIXON AND DATT PAID JULY 7 CALFNON COLONEL
LEVINSON (IDF LIAISON OFFICER289.  *.).  ONLY ONE POINT OF
PARTICULAR INTEREST EMERGED.
2.  LEVINSON CITED SHORT VISIT TO EGYPT AND ISRAEL
(CONCLUDED TODAY) BY DR. JONAH OF THE UN, DURING WHICH JONAH
BRIEFED ISRAELIS ON AT LEAST PART OF HIS CONVERSATION WITH
BSBHTIANS.  ACCORDING TO LEVINSON, JONAH SAID THAT FONMIN
FAHMY AND GENERAL MAGDOUB (AMONG OTHERS) ARE CHALLENGING THE
CONCEPT OF A UN BUFFER ZONE.  EGYPTIAN ARGUMENT IS THAT AREA
CN QUESTION IS SOVEREIGN EGYPTIAN TERRITORY.  THEY APPARENTLY
CONCEDE THAT SINAI II REQUIRES THIS AREA BE DEMILITARIZED,
BUT ARGUE THAT NONMILITARY EGYPTIAN PRESENCE SHOULD NOT
BE REGULATED.
3. ACCORDING TO LEVINSON, EGYPT HAS BEEN FLOATING THIS
IDEA FOR LAST FEW WEEKS.  HE SUGGESTED THAT IT MAY BE JUST
A TACTICAL MOVE DESIGNED TO TRY TO STEAL A MARCH XARING
GENERAL SIILASVUO'S ABSENCE.  IN ANY CASE, LEVINSON SAID
THAT EYGPT HAD NOW POSTPONED ANY JOINT COMMISSION NEGOTIATIONS
UNTIL AFTER SIILASVUO'S RETURN (APPARENTLY AUGUST 1).
4.  COMMENT:  DESPITE HIS HOPEFUL SUGGESTION THAT IT MAY BE
JUST A STRAWMAN, LEVINSON SEEMED TO TAKE THIS ISSUE VERY
SERIOUSLY.  HE WAS AT GREAT PAINS TO CHALLENGE VALIDITY OF
EGYPTIAN ARGUMENT, CITING VARIOUS PASSAGES FROM SINAI II
AGREEMENT.

 * 23595 1976BEIRUT05857 0.007107134 | 1976-07-04 | BEIRUT | STATE | MEETING WITH RAYMOND EDDE JULY 3
1. SUMMARY: IN A CONVERSATION LASTING ALMOST THREE HOURS, EDDE
REVEALED HIMSELF AS A GREAT TALKER AND AN INDEPENDENT INTELLECT
WHOSE REMARKS ARE SCATTERED WIDELY TO THE WINDS. AS IN CASE OF
OTHER TOP LEADERS I HAVE TLKED TO SO FAR, EDDE EMPHAIZED THE
PRIMORDIAL NEED FOR SYRIAN WITHDRAWAL BEFORE PEACE CAN BE
ESTABLISHED UNDER ARAB LEAGUE AUSPICES OR OTHERWISE. HE EXPRES-
SED CONTINUING HOPES IN A SUEFUL USG ROLE IN LEBANON BUT EVIDENCED
BELIEF
THAT USG HAD THUS FAR COLLUDED WITH SYRIA AND ISRAEL RE LEBANON.
HE THOUGHT THAT USG COULD DO MUCH INDIRECTLY THROUGH THE SYRIANS
AND MIGHT, FOR EXAMPLE, FACILITATE A SYRIAN WITHDRAWAL--WHICH
WOULD PRESERVE LEBANESE TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY FROM SYRIAN AMBITIONS--
BY HELPINF FINANCE SYRIAN COSTS OF THEIR MILITARY ACTION IN
LEBANON. USG SHOULD ALSO PRES FOR FRANGIE'S RESIGNATION. HE THOUGHT
CURRENT SITUATION PLACES USG IN A GOOD POSITION TO COME
TO GRIPS WITH RESOLUTION OF PALESTINIAN PROBLEM. US NOW
ENJOYS GOOD REALTIONS WITH BOTH SADAT AND ASSAD. HE WAS
WITHERING INDESCRIBING THE VENALITY, FASLE AMBITIONS AND
MALICIOUS STUPIDITY WHICH ALLEGEDLY PREVAIL AMONG TOP MARONITE
LEADERS IN THE CHRISTIAN PART OF THE COUNTRY. HE BELIEVD
CHAMOUN AND GEMAYEL CAN SEE NO SOLUTION, NOW THAT THIER PEOPLE
HAVE KILLED SO MANY MOSLEMS, OTHER THAN TO PUSH FOR PARTITION.
WHILE EMPHASIZING SARKIS'S LACK OF POLITICAL FOLLOWING, EDDE
CLAIMED TO BE PREPARED TO HELP THE MAN IF FRANGIE COULD SOMEHOW
BE MADE TO RESIGN. HE SAID HE PERSONALLY WAS NOT RPT NOT
BITTER AT NOT HAVING BEEN ELECTED PRESIDENT. HE PREDICTED AN
ONGOING EFFORT BY CHAMOUN TO GET SARKIS'S RESIGNATION FIRST, AFTER
WHICH CHAMOUN WOULD HOPE TO SUCCEED FRANGIE AS PRESIDENT. RE
THE FUTURE, EDDE SAID THAT IF SYRIANS WITHDRAW AND PALESTINIAN
PRESENCE IN LEBANON IS REGULATED, HE COULD FORESEE POSSIBILITY OF
MOSLEMS AND CHRISTIANS LIVING TOGETHER AGAIN IN A UNITED LEBANON.
LEBANESE MOSLEMS' NEWLY-DEVELOPED ANTIPATHY TOWARD SYRIA WOULD
BE CONTRIBUTING FACTOR. BUT A "FINAL SOLUTION" MUST AWAIT SETTLE
MENT OF PALESTINIAN PROBLEM. LEBANON WOULD NEVER BE SAME AGAIN AND
IT MUST AVOID A RETURN TO "GANGSTERISM" OF THE RICH. END SUMMARY
2. ON JULY 3 I TOOK LAMBRAKIS WITH ME TO CALL ON EDDE IN HIS HOME
OFF RUE HAMRA, WHER HE STILL IS RECUPERATING FROM LEG WOUNDS HE
SUFFERED WHEN PHALANGISTS AOTACKED HIM IN HIS CAR LITTLE OVER A
MONTH AGO. I EXPLAINED NATURE OF MY MISSION TO HIM. I SAID
FACT PRESIDENT HAD MOVED SO QUICKLY TO SELECT SPECIAL EMISSARY
TO LEBANON FOLLOWING TRAGIC DEATH AMBASSADOR MELOY REFLECTS
IMPORTANCE USG ATTACHES TO LEBANON AND CONCERN WE HAVE FOR
DETERIRATING SITUATION. I TOLD HIM WE OPPOSE PARTITION IN LEBANON
AND DEBUNKED STORY OF A PLOT INVOLVING US WITH THE SYRIANS AND
ISRAELIS. EDDE MADE NO BONES ABOUT CONTINUING TO BELIEVE IN
THE PLOT, WICH HE ADMITTED HAVING PUBLICLY ALLEGED FOR A COUPLE
OF YEARS. AFTER SOME DISCUSSION OF THE MELOY MURDER, IN
WHICH EDDE'S ROLE HAD BEEN TO PASS THE WORD OF THE KIDNAPPING
FROM THE EMBASSY TO VARIOUS PALESTINIANS, WE GOT INTO LONG
DISCUSSION, MUCH OF IT BACKGROUND BUT INGTERESTING NEVER-
THELESS.
3. EDDE FIRST DISCUSSED THE PALESTINIANS. THERE ARE SOME 400,000
WHO HAVE, SOMEWHREE ELSE TO GO. NO ONE WANTS THEM. HE
RECALLED A VISIT HE MADE TO SADAT SHORTLY AFTER SADAT TOOK POWER.
SADAT TALKED TO HIM FOR OVER THREE HOURS IN THE COURSE OF WHICH
HE SAID HE WAS GONG TO BUILD AN ARMY OF 700,000 TO FIGHT ISRAEL.
WHEN SADAT ASKED WHAT LEBANON COULD DO TO HELP, EDDE OFFERED
50 - 100,000 PALESTINIANS LOCATED IN LEBANON, WHO WOULD BE
HAPPY TO JOIN SADAT IN FIGHTING FOR THEIR HOMELAND. SADAT REFUSED
THE OFFER, SAYING PAESTINIANS WERE MUCH TOO COMPLICATED AND
WOULD GIVE HIM TROUBLE. SMILARLY, EDDE REMEMBERS THAE TIME
IN 1973 WHEN HE AGREED TO VISIT DAMASCUS AND SEE ASSAD AFTER
ASSAD HAD CUT THE ROAD INTO LEBANON. KADDAM HAD MET HIM AT
THE BORDER, FOLLOWING WHICH ASSAD HAD RECEIVED HIM ROYALLY,
KEEPING HIM FOR FOUR AND A HALF HOURS. (EDDE JOKINGLY SAID HE
WONDERED IF DICTATORS HAD THAT MUCH TO DO WITH THEIR TIME IN LIGHT
OF THESE TWO EXPERIENCES. WE SUSPECT EDDE DID A GOOD DEAL OF
TALKING HIMSELF.) ACCORDING TO EDDE, ASSAD SAID HE WANTED TO
ASISE AN ARMY OF 3-400,000 MEN TO FIGHT ISRAEL, AND EDDE MADE
THE SAME OFFER OF PALESTINIANS WHICH WAS SIMILARLY DECLINED BY
ASSAD. ALL THIS IS UNFORTUNATE, EDDE TOLD US, SINCE SYRIA NEEDS
WORKERS.
4. STILL RECOLLECTING THE PAST, EDDE REFERRED TO A CONVERSATION
FRANGIE HAD WITH ARAFAT IN 1973 IN EDDE'S PRESENCE. THIS WAS
AFTER HALF-HEARTED LEBANESE EFFORTS TO CRUSH THE PALESTINIANS
HAD FAILED. EDDE SAID FRANGIE TOLD ARAFAT,"I WOULD HAVE LIQUI-
DATED YOU IF I COULD HAVE." ARAFAT IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN
SURPRISED. FRANGIE IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE SAID, "YOU SHOULD PROTECT
YOURSELF," AND WHEN ARAFAT ASKED HOW, FRANGIE MADE TE
SUGGESTION THAT HE ARM HIMSELF. (COMMENT: I SUSPECT THIS STORY
IS AT LEAST PARTLY APOCRYPHAL, BUT THERE IS LITTLE QUESTION THAT
FRANGIE'S ATTITUDE AT THE TIME ACCURATLEY CONVEYED SUCH A MESSAGE.)
5. EDDE REVIEWED PALESTINIAN ARMAMENT AND THE WAY
IN WHICH THEY BRANDISH SUCH ARMS, WHICH LEBANESE HAVE COME
INCREASINGLY TO RESENT. EDDE NOTED IN PASSING HIS OWN ROLE IN
VOTING AGAINST THE CAIRO ACCORDS AS BOTH A VIOLATION OF EEBANON'S
ARMISTICE WITH ISRAEL AND AS A HARBINGER OF TOROUBLE BETWEEN
LEBANON AND PALESTINIANS. IT WAS AT THAT TIME (1973) THAT TOP
CHRISTIAN LEADERS DECIDED ON CREATION OF MILITIA TO MATCH THE
PALESTINIANS. EDDE HIMSELF SAID HE WOULD NOT RAISE SUCH A MILITA
AND WOULD REMAIN ON GOOD TERMS WITH THE MOSLESM, SO AS TO
PROTECT CHRISTIAN INTERESTS JUST I  CASE MOSLEMS WON. HE SAID
ALTERNATIVE OF ENLARGING THE ARMY WAS NOT FEASIBLE SINCE PARLIA-
MENT WAS NOT ABOUT TOVOTE NECESSARY FUNDS, AND ARMY WOULD FALL
APART INTO CHRISTIAN AND MOSLEM FACTIONS IF IT HAD TRIED TO FIGHT
PALESTINIANS. THERE HAD NEVER BEEN ANY QUESTION OF FGHTING THE
ISRAELIS.

6. EDDE THEN WENT INTO A LONG DISCOURSE ON VARIOUS PLANS AND
PLOTS IN THE PAST TO RECREAT DIVISIONS OF LEBANON AND SYRIA INTO
CHRSTIAN, CRUZE, ALAWITE, SUNNIE, ETC., PARTS, WHICH HAD
RECURRED IN RECENT HISTORY FROM CLEMENCAU ONWARDS. EACH
HAD AN ISRAELI ANGLE INLTHE CONTINUED AMBITION OF ISRAEL FOR THE
WATERS OF THE LITANI RIVER. UPSHOT OF THIS WAS THAT SYRIA, WHICH
HAD NEVER RECOGNIZED LEBANON'S ANNEXATION AFTER WORLD WAR II
OF THE BEKAA, AKKAR AND TRIPOLI AREAS,MAINTAINED ITS AMBITION
TO TAKE THEM OVER. EDDE CONTENDED THAT IF THIS WERE NOT TRUE,
ARMY WOULD NOT NOW BE OCCUPYING THE HERMEL TRIBAL AREA IN
THE AKKARAN OR MOVING INTO BAALBEK IN THE BEKAA, NEITHER OF
WHICH WAS THE SCENE OF GREAT FIGHTING. HE RECOGNIZED THE
SYRIAN SERVICE IN OPENING THE BLOCKADE OF THE CHRISTIANS AT
ZAHLE, BUT WONDERED WHY THE SYRIANS HAD ATTACKED SIDON. HE
NOTED A GREAT DEAL OF PILLAGING BY SYRIANS AND PARTICULARLY THE
SAIQA, INCLUDING DESTRUCTION BY THE SAIQA OF LEBANESE BANKS, THE
PORT, ARTESIAN WELLS AND EVEN THE SIDON OIL REFINERY A FEW DAYS
AGO. HE ALLEGED THAT ALL THIS WAS ON ASSAD'S PERSONAL ORDERS.
HE DISAGREED WITH THOSE WHO CLAIM THAT LEBANON'S PROBLEMS ARE
AN INTERNAL MATTER ONLY. HE WENT INTO A LONG DISSERTATION ON THE
WILES OF THE ALAWITE RELIGION, "WHICH HAPPENST TO BE MORE
CHRISTIAN THAN MOSLEM", AND THE SUGGESTED DUPLICITY OF THE
ALAWITES.
7. EDDE TALKED AT SOME LENGTH ABOUT THE PERSONAL VENALITY AND
UNTOWARD AMBITIONS OF TH OTHER TOP MARONITE LEADERS, PARTICULARLY
GEMAFTIVAND CHAMOUNM HE DESCRIBED IN GREAT DETAIL A SERIES OF
INCIDENTS IN HIS OWN PEACEFUL DISTRICT AROUND BYBLOS, WITHT
PHALANGE TERRORIZING LOCAL CITIZENRY. IN ONE CASE FIVE GREEK
ORTHODOX HHTDC
T  -;3&3)6 297,$3$ -,$ (8))3$ ?6 0#-)-,&8 5 ,
AND AN ATTACK ON EDDE HIMSELF WAS MOUNTED BY THE PHALANGE THE
DAY HE WENT UP TO PRESENT HIS CONDOLENCES TO THEIR RELATIVES.
8. THIS LED EDDE TO THE ASSERTION THAT TOP CHRISTIANS SUCH AS
CHAMOUN WANT PARTITION BECAUSE THEY HAVE KILLED TOO MANY
MOSLEMS AND ARE AFRAID TO EVER TRY TO LIVE IN A STATE WHERE THEY
HAVE TO MIX WITH THEM AGAIN. IT IS A PERSONAL, PHYSICAL THING.
THESE MEN WILL NEVER KNOW WHEN SOMEONE MAY SHOOT AT THEM
SEEKING REVENGE. CHAMOUN HAS ALSO SET FORTH A SERIES OF OTHER
ALTERNATIVES, INCLUDING CREATION OF CANTONS ALONG LINES OF
DIVISIONS UNDER THE TURKS OR CONFEDERATION BETWEEN A CHRISTIAN
AND A MOSLEM STATE.
9. A RELATED IMPERATIVE CONTINUED EDDE, IS THAT THESE TOP
MARONITE LEADERS CANNOT EXPLAIN TO THEIR PEOPLE WHY THE WAR
HAS BEEN FOUGHT. WHAT HAVE THEY GAINED? IS IT TELL ZAATAR? IS
THAT WORTH FIGHTING 15 MONTHS FOR? DO THE CRISTIANS NOT REALIZE
THAT, ALONG WITH PALESTINIANS, TELL ZAATAR CONTAINED MANY SHIITES,
CHEAP LABOR WHICH FLED FROM THE SOUTH AND WHICH HELPED TO BUILD
THE CHRISTIAN FACTORIES IN THE AREA AROUND THE TELL ZAATAR AREA?
IN REPLY TO MY DIRECT QUESTION WHETHER, LE ING ASIDE QUESTION OF
SYRIAN WITHDRAWAL AND ARRANGEMENTS OF RELATIONSHIPS WITH
PALESTINIANS, HE COULD FORESEE MOSLEM AND CHRISTIAN LEBANESE
BEING PREPARED TO LIVE TOGETHER AGAIN, EDDE WAS NOT ALTOGETHER
SURE. NEVERTHELESS, HE TENDED TO BE POSITIVE BECAUSE HE SAID NOW,
FOR THE FIRST TIME, SUNNI MOSLEMS FEAR AND HATE THE SYRIANS
PROBABLY MORE THAN THE CHRISTIANS.
10. HIS RECURRING THEME WAS THAT THE SYRIANS MUST LEAVE FIRST
BEFORE USEFUL DIALOGUE TO END THE FIGHTING COULD BE ACHIEFED. SHOULD
PEACE RETURN, HE FORESAW CHRISTIAN MILITIAS KEEPING THEIR ARMS AS
LONG AS PALESTINIANS DO. THIS LED HIM TO BELIEVE THAT THE FINAL
SOLUTION TO THE LEBANESE PROBLEM HAD TO AWAIT SOLUTION OF THE
PALESTINIAN PROBLEM IN THE AREA. IN THE MEANWHILE, HOWEVER, A
TEMPORARY ARRANGEMENT, WITH THE SYRIANS OUT OF THE COUNTRY, WOULD
MORE LIKELY THAN NOT LEAD TO WARRING AMONG THE TOP CHRISTIAN
FACTIONS, IN PARTICULAR THE SONS OF GEMAYEL AGAINST THE SONS OF
CHAMOUN AND PERHAPS TONY FRANGIE'S PEOPLE. IN FACT, HE THOUGHT
MOSLEMS WOULD FORGIVE CHRISTIANS FASTER THE THE CHRSTIAN MARONITES
WILL FORGIVE MOSLEMS FOR WHAT HAS HAPPENED.
11. WHILE EMPHASIZING SARKIS'S LACK OF A POLITICA FOLLOWING, AS HAD
SAEB SALAM, EDDE CLAIMED TO BE PREPARED TO HELP THE MAN IF FRANGIE
COULD SOMEHOW BE MADE TO RESIGN. HE SAID HE PERSONALLY WAS
NOT BITTER ABOUT NOT HAVING BEEN ELECTED PRESIDENT.
12. EDDE SAID HE WISHED TO MAKE A PREDICTION. CHAMOUN WILL
MAKE GREATER AND GREATER EFFORTS TO GET SARKIS TO RESIGN THE
PRESIDENCY. THESE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL, BUT THAT IS THE
DIRECTION IN WHICH CHAMOUN'S MIND RUNS. HE WOULD HOPE TO
DTSTITUTE HIMSELF FOR SARKIS AS PRESIDENT AS A CONDITION OF
FRANGIE'S RESIGNATION. HE STATED THAT THE U.S., WITHOUT INVOLVING
ITSELF DIRECTLY, MIGHT SOMEHOW HELP PREVENT ALL THIS BY PUSIHING FOR
FRANGIE'S RESIGNAOION AND SYRIAN WITHDRAWAL. U.S. IS IN A BETTER
POSITION THAN EVER BEFORE IN COMING TO GRIPS WITH OVERALL SOLUTION
OF PALESTINIAN PROBLEM. U.S.HAS SADAT WITH IT AND MAY BE GETTING
TO THE POINT WHERE IT HAS ASSAD'S COOPERATION TOO. AS LONG AS THE
SYRIANS REMAIN, LEBANESE AND PALESTINIANS WILL FIGHT THEM
TOGETHER, EDDE EMPHASIZED. EDDE SAID HE HAD GREAT HOPES OF TOE
U.S. HE FLET SECRETARY KISSINGER MUST KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING IN
THE LEBANON AND HE DID NOT SEE WHY THE U.S., TO SAVE ISRAEL,
WOULD WISH TO SEE LEBANON DESTROYED. HE THOUGHT THE USG COULD DE
MUCH INDIRECTLY THROUGH THE SYRIANS AND PERHAPS FACILITIATING A
SYRIAN WITHDRAWAL-- WHICH WOULD PRESERVE LEBANESE TERRITORIAL
INTEGRITY FROM SYRIAN AMBITIONS-- BY HELPING FINANCE SYRIANS COSTS
THEIR MILITARY ACTION IN LEBANON.
13. LEBANON HAS GONE THROUGH A DIFFICULT PERIOD, EDDE SAID. THE
"LEBANESE MIRACLE" HAS ENDED. BUT THEN THE FRENCH HAD HAD
THEIR OCCUPATION UNDER THE GERMANS IN WORLD WAR II, THE U.S.
HAD HAD ITS VIET-NAM, AND SUCH THINGS HAPPEN TO NATIOS. THE
LEBANESE CAN PICK THEMSELVES UP AND FIND OUT WHO THEY ARE IN
REBUILDING THEIR COUNTRY. HE WAS SURE THAT THE SYRIANS WOULD
SOMEHOW PRESENT A BILL FOR THE COSTS OF THEIR ARMY'S ENTRY INTO
LEBANON. PRIOR TO WITHDRAWAL, THEY WOULD DEMAND TERRITORY FOR
COMPENSATION-.UNLESS THE USG WOULD PICK UP THESE COSTS IN ITS
USUAL GENEROUS WAY. LEBANON CANNOT BE THE SAME AGAIN, AND IT
MUST AVOID A RETURN TO THE "GANGSTERISM" OF THE RICH, WHO ARE FOR THE
MOST PART IN PARIS ORE SOMEWHERE ELSE. AT THE SAME TIME, IT
CANNOT  BECOME A GHETTO INTO WHICH CHRISTIANS ARE PUSHED
BY ALL THE ARAB STATES, AND WHERE RULE IS BY PHALANGE FASCISTS.
A SEPARATE CHRISTIAN STATE IS NOT VIABLE ECONOMICALLY AND HE SAW
NO REASON WHY USG WOULD GIVE IT ASSISTANCE. YET THESE CONTINUE TO
BE THE DREAMS OF TOP CHRISTIAN LEADERS LIKE CHAMOUN AND GEMAYEL.
14. EN PASSANT, EDDE SAID THE SOVIETS HAVE SENT A SPECIAL MISSION
TO STUDY THE QUESTION OF WHY SOVIET TANKS "MELTED AWAY" WHEN THE
SYRIANS USED THEM IN THE LEBANON. EDDE ASSUMED THE ANSWER LAY
IN FACT THAT SOVIETS NEVER ENVISAGED SITUATION SUCH AS THAT WHICH
OCCURRED IN SIDON, WHEN TEN STUDENTS ARMED WITH RPG'S FIRED
ALMOST SIMULTANEOUSLY FROM A FEW YARD'S DISTANCE.
ABU IYAD HAD TOLD EDDE THAT 72 SYRIAN TANKS HAD BEEN DESTROYED
IN LEBANON.
15. COMMENT: EDDE REAMINS A MAVERICK. ALTHOUGH HE IS ONE
OF THE OLD-LINE MARONITE TOP LEADERS, HE HAS A MUCH BROADER VIEW
OF THE NEEDS OF OTHER COMMUNITIES AND A MORE HUMANITARIAN
APPROACH TO LIFE. HE HAS CONSISTENTLY RETAINED GOOD RELATIONSHIPS
BOTH WITH THE PALESTINIANS AND WITH THE SUNNI CONSERVATIVE MUSLIMS,
AND AS SOMEONE WHO GREW UP WITH JUMBLATT, HE HAS A PERSONAL
RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM THAT APPEALS MORE TO JUMBLATT'S BASIC
LEBANESE DRUZE MOSLEMS THAN TO JUMBLATT'S LEFTIST POSEURS.
A CONSERVATIVE, WITH RULING TRADITIONS IN THE FAMILY, HE
IS STILL ONE OF THE CLOSEST THINGS LEBANO HAS IN THE WAY OF A TRUE
DEOOCRAT. HE IS NOT UP TO THE MENTAL AGILITY OF FOXES SUCH AS
CHAMOUN AND JUMBLATT, BUT IS CONSIDERED MORE INTELLIGENT THAN
GEMAYEL OR FRANGIE. EDDE IS A GREAT TALKER AND HE FINDS IT HARD
TO STICK TO A TOPIC WITHOUT MAKING ANECDOTAL DIGRESSIONS. VERY
MUCH A POLITICAL ANIMAL, HE IS A BACHELOR WITHOUT A CLOSE FAMILY
AND REAMINS DEVOTED TO THE POLITICAL GAME EVEN THOUG HE HAS
HAD SO MANY NEAR MISSES IN THE PRESIDENTIAL SWEEPSTAKES.

ANNEX
MESSAGE DATED 4 JULY 1976 FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE
REPUBLIC OF UGANDA
THE PRIME MINISTER OF MAURITIUS, CURRENT CHAIRMAN
OF THE ORGANIZATION OF AFRICAN UNITY,
PORT LOUIS,
MAURITIUS.
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL,
NEW YORK
THE SECRETARY-GENERAL,
UNITED NATIONS,
NEW YORK.
I WISH TO BRING TO YOUR URGENT ATTENTION THE MOST SERIOUS
INCIDENT WHICH OCCURRED AT ENTEBBA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT ON THE
NIGHT OF 3-4 JULY 1976.
AT 2120 GMT, THREE ZIONIST ISRAEL TRANSPORT PLANES LANDED BY
SURPRISE AND WITHOUT ANY AUTHORITY FROM THE UGANDA GOVERNMENT
AT ENTEBBE INTERNATIONSL AIRPORT. SOON AFTER LANDING THEY
PROCEEDED STRAIGHT TO THE OLD AIRPORT BUILDING, WHERE THE
HOSTAGES AND THE CREW OF THE FRENCH AIRBUS WHICH HAD BEEN
HIJACKED IN FLIGHT BETWEEN TEL AVIV AND PARIS WERE BEING HELD BY
PALESTINIAN COMMANDOS. TWO MILITARY JEEPS DROVE OUT OF THE
AIRCRAFT AND THE INVADERS, USING MACHINE-GUNS AND BAZOOKAS,
STATED SHOOTING INDISCRIMINATELY AT THE AIRPORT BUILDING AND
AT UGANDAN SOLDIERS WHO HAD SURROUNDED THE BUILDING AT A DISTANCE
OF 200 METRES AND WHO, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CONDITIONS LAID
DOWN BY THE HIJACKERS OF THE FRENCH PLANE, WERE ARMED ONLY
WITH LIGHT ARMS.
THE ISRAELI INVADERS QUICKLY MOUNTED AN ATTACK ON THE HIJACKERS,
KILLING SEVEN OF THEM AND SOME HOSTAGES, AS WELL AS A
NUMBER OF UGANDAN SOLDIERS, AND INJURING MANY OTHERS. THE
ISRAELI INVADERS ALSO BLASTED THE OLD AIRPORT BUILDING,
CAUSING CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE AND DESTROYING A NUMBER OF UGANDAN
AIRCRAFT, WHICH WERE PARKED NEARBY, AND OTHER EQUIPMENT.
YOU MAY WISH TO RECALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND THE SITUATION OF THE
AIRCRAFT THAT EXISTED SINCE THE HIJACKING DRAMA CAME TO UGANDA
AT 4:15 A.M. ON 28 JUNE, MOST NOTABLE OF WHICH WAS THAT THE
AIRCRAFT HAD FUEL FOR ONLY FIFTEEN MORE MINUTES. ON BEING
CONTACTED, I ALLOWED THE AIRCRAFT TO LAND AT ENTEBBE ON
HUMANITARIAN CONSIDERATIONS. AFTER THE LANDING, I TOOK THE
INITIATIVE, AS PRESIDENT OF THE REQUBLIC OF UGANDA AND THEN
CHAIRMAN OF THE ORGANIZATION OF AFRICAN UNITY (OAU), TO
NEGOTIATE THE RELEASE OF THE HOSTAGES. MY MAIN INTEREST ALL
ALONG WAS TO SAVE THE LIVES OF SOME 275 PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT
NATIONALITIES WHICH WERE AT STAKE. TO THAT END, I DIRECTED
THAT THE PLANE BE GUARDED PROPERLY WHILE I NEGOTIATED WITH
THE MEMBERS OF THE PFLP WHO WERE THE HIJACKERS OF THE PLANE.
MY FIRST SUCCESS WAS TO HAVE THE HOSTAGES REMOVED FROM THE
AIRCRAFT INTO THE AIRPORT BUILDING, A PROCESS WHICH WAS
ACHIEVED AFTER THE HIJACKERS HAD INSISTED FIRST OF ALL ON
PLACING EXPLOSIVES ROUND THE BUILDING BEFORE BRINGING THE
AEROPLANE NEARBY SO AS TO ENABLE THEIR HOSTAGES TO BE SECURELY
TRANSPORTED FROM THE AIRCRAFT TO THE BUILDING. AS WE HAVE
CLEARLY STATED IN VARIOUS COMMUNIQUES ON THE HIJACKING, THE
UGANDA ARMED FORCES WERE NOT ALLOWED BY THE HIJACKERS TO GO
NEAR THE AIRPORT BUILDING. THIS WAS PART OF THE BARGAIN.
HOWEVER, ONCE THEY WERE IN THE AIRPORT BUILDING, UNDER MY
DIRECTIVES, MANY FACILITIES, SUCH AS MEDICAL AND FOOD SUPPLIES
AND OTHER WELFARE TREATMENT WERE MADE AVAILABLE TO THE HOSTAGES,
WHILE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE HIJACKERS CONTINUED.
ON 30 JUNE 1976, THE PFLP ACCEPTED MY REQUEST TO RELEASE 47
HOSTAGES, INCLUDING OLD AND SICK PEOPLE AND SOME CHILDREN.
ON 1 JULY 1976, WHICH WAS THE FIRST DEADLINE SET BY THE
HIJACKERS, I WAS NOT ONLY ABLE TO CONVICE THEM TO EXTEND THE
DEADLINE TO 4 JULY, THAT IS, TODAY, BUT I WAS ALSO ABLE TO
MAKE THEM AGREE TO THE RELEASE OF ANOTHER 100 HOSTAGES WHO WERE
NATIONALS OF STATES OTHER THAN ISRAEL. IN ALL THESE DIFFICULT
NEGOTIATIONS I KEPT THE FRENCH AMBASSADOR TO UGANDA FULLY
INFORMED AND ALSO THE SOMALI AMBASSADOR TO UGANDA WHO, IN HIS
CAPACITY AS DEAN OF THE ARAB LEAGUE AMBASSADORS IN UGANDA,
HAD BEEN APPOINTED BY THE HIJACKERS TO BE THEIR SPOKESMAN.
ON THAT SAME DATE (1 JULY ), THE HIJACKERS GAVE THEIR
DEMANDS, WHICH WERE WIDELY PUBLICIZED AND TRANSMITTED TO ALL THE
GOVERNMENTS CONCERNED AS THE DEMANDS WERE ENTIRELY FOR THE
RELEASE OF A NUMBER OF PALESTINIAN FREEDOM FIGHTERS WHO HAD
BEEN IMPRISONED IN WEST GERMANY, SWITZERLAND, FRANCE AND KENYA,
AS WELL AS ISRAEL, IN ALL TOTALLING 53. ON 2 JULY 1976, I HAD TO
GO TO PORT LOUIS, MAURITIUS, TO HAND OVER THE CHAIRMANSHIP
OF THE OAU AT THE THIRTEENTH SUMMIT OF OAU HEADS OF STATE AND
GOVERNMENT. I TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY OF ADDRESSING MY COLLEAGUES
OF THE OAU ON THE SUBJECT OF THE DELICATE NEGOTIATIONS THAT I WAS
MAKING TO HAVE THE HOSTAGES AND THE FRENCH AIRLINER RELEASED.
I HAD TO RETURN TO UGANDA IN TIME FOR THE NEW DEADLINE OF 4
JULY, MADE BY THE HIJACKERS.
UPON MY RETURN, I QUICKLY RE-ESTABLISHED CONTACTS WITH ALL
PERSONS CONCERNED. I SPOKE TO THE HOSTAGES AND ASSURED THEM OF
MY EFFORTS TO DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO SAVE THEIR LIVES.
THE ISRAELI HOSTAGES THEMSELVES WERE VERY HAPPY WITH WHAT I
WAS DOING, WHICH IS PARTLY WHY, ON 3 JULY, THEY ISSUED A STATE-
MENT OF APPRECIATION FOR MY EFFORTS. THEY ALSO MADE AN APPEAL
TO THEIR GOVERNMENT TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF THE HIJACKERS SO THAT
THEIR LIVES WOULD BE SAVED. AFTER THE BRIEF MEETING WITH THE
HOSTAGES, I GOT IN TOUCH WITH THE FRENCH
AMBASSADOR THROUGH MY FOREIGN OFFICE TO CHECK ON WHETHER
THERE HAD BEEN ANY RESPONSE FROM HIS GOVERNMENT AND THE
OTHER GOVERNMENTS CONCERNED ON THE SUBJECT OF THE HIJACKERS'
DEMANDS. AS THE EXTENDED DEALINE WAS ONLY SOME 12 HOURS
AWAY, WHILE WAITING FOR THE INFORMATION, I CONTINUED MY
NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE PFLP COMMANDOS. THIS IS THE TIME WHEN
ISRAELI INVADING FORCES ARRIVED AT ENTEBBE.
I SHOULD LIKE TO BRING TO YOUR ATTENTION SOME ASPECTS OF THE
ISRAELI INVASION SHOWING THAT IT HAD BEEN WELL PLANNED AND
REHEARSED WITH THE  FULL COLLABORATION OF SOME OTHER COUNTRIES.
ACCORDING TO THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO US, WHICH HAS BEEN
REPEATEDLY CONFIRMED BY THE INTERNATIONAL PRESS, THE ZIONIST
ISRAELI PLAN TO INVADE ENTEBBA WAS DECIDED UPON ON THURSDAY,
1 JULY. THIS DECISION WAS COMMUNICATED TO THE KENYA
AUTHORITIES, WHOSE CONSENT AND ASSISTANCE IN THE OPERATION
WAS IMMEDIATELY OBTAINED.
THIS COLLABORATION HAS BEEN CONFIRMED BY THE FACT THAT THE
ISRAELI PLANES ON THEIR WAY TO AND FROM UGANDA STOPPED AT
NAIROBI WHERE, FOR EXAMPLE, A MOBILE OPERATING THEATRE WAS
SET UP TO TAKE CARE OF THE INVADERS' CASUALTIES. IT IS MOST
DISTURBING AND DISHEARTENING TO US IN UGANDA THAT SUCH A BLATANT
AND OPEN INVASION OF OUR COUNTRY SHOULD HAVE BEEN MOUNTED BY THE
ZIONISTS WITH THE CLOSE COLLABORATION OF KENYA, A NEIGHBOURING
SISTER STATE WHICH IS A MEMBER OF BOTH THE OAU AND THE UNITED
NATIONS. FURTHER ASPECTS OF THIS PLOT TO INVADE UGANDA HAVE
BEEN REVEALED BY THE INTERANTIONAL PRESS, NOTABLY THE VOICE OF
AMERICA - WHICH ANNOUNCED THE INVASION BARELY TWO HOURS AFTER
IT HAD BEEN MOUNTED - AND BY THE LEADING BRITISH SUNDAY
NEWSPAPERS, WHICH ARE CARRYING ON THEIR FRONT PAGES THE
DETAILS OF THE OPERATION. IT IS FURTHER REPORTED THAT THE
FOREIGN MINISTER OF ISRAEL IS TODAY, 4JULY, MAKING DIRECT
REPORTS ON THE INVASION TO THE AMERICAN SECRETARY OF STATE
AND TO THE FOREIGN MINISTERS OF FRANCE AND WEST GERMANY.
THESE ARE REPORTS CLEARLY REVEALING WELL PLANNED INTERNATIONAL
COLLABORATION IN A PLOT TO VIOLATE AND ABUSE THE TERRITORIAL
INTEGRITY OF UGANDA. THE HIJACKING INCIDENT, IN WHICH UGANDA
WAS ACCIDENTALLY INVOLVED AND ON WHICH I PERSONALLY SPENT
MANY SLEEPLESS DAYS, HAS THUS ENDED BY INNOCENT
UGANDANS LOSING THEIR LIVES AND PROPERTY ASIDE FROM THE
THOUSANDS OF SHILLINGS SPENT ON LOOKING AFTER THE HOSTAGES ON
HUMANITARIAN GROUNDS.
ON THE BASIS OF THE FOREGOING, I WISH TO IMPRESS UPON THE
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY THAT:
1. UGANDA HAS BEEN AGGRESSED BY ISRAEL WITH THE CLOSE
COLLABORATION OF SOME STATES, INCLUDING KENYA, A SISTER
NEIGHBOURING STATE;
2. THE AGGRESSORS HAVE KILLED A NUMBER OF UGANDANS, INJURED
MANY OTHERS AND DAMAGED A LOT OF PROPERTY, THE TOTAL COST
OF WHICH IS BEING ASSESSED;
3. IT IS THE INTENTION OF MY GOVERNMENT TO CLAIM COMPENSATION
ARISING FROM THIS AGGRESSION.
I REQUEST THAT THE  INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS FOR WHICH YOU
ARE THE RESPECTIVE SPOKESMEN, BE FULLY BRIEFED ON THIS
INCIDENT AND THAT ISRAEL BE CONDEMNED IN THE STRONGEST
POSSIBLE TERMS FOR THE AGGRESSION. IN THE MEANTIME, UGANDA
RESERVES HER RIGHT TO RETALIATE IN WHATEVER WAY SHE CAN TO
REDRESS THE AGGRESSION AGAINST HER.
HIGHEST CONSIDERATIONS,
(SIGNED) AL-HAJJI FIELD-MARSHAL DR. IDI AMIN DADA,
V.C., D.S.O., M.C.,

SUMMARY
1. CHU TEH DIES
THE DEATH JULY 6 OF MARSHAL CHU TEH, POLITBURO STANDING
COMMITTEE MEMBER, CHAIRMAN OF THE NPC STANDING COMMITTEE
AND COMMANDER OF THE COMMUNIST TROOPS DURING THE CIVIL WAR
YEARS, LEAVES THE STANDING COMMITTEE WITH ONLY FIVE MEMBERS.
IT ALSO REMOVES FROM THE POLITBURO ONE OF THE STAUNCHEST
DEFENDERS OF THE OLD GUARD, A MAN WHO IS REPORTED TO HAVE
OPPOSED TENG HSIAO-PING'S DISMISSAL EARLIER THIS YEAR. WITH
CHU GONE, AGING DEFENSE MINISTER YEH CHIEN-YING IS THE ONLY
PRE-CULTURAL REVOLUTION FIGURE, OTHER THAN MAO HIMSELF, WHO
REMAINS ON THE STANDING COMMITTEE (HONG KONG 7898). CONFIDENTIAL
2. PARTY DAY EDITORIAL AND PROVINCIAL REACTION
THE FIRST JOINT EDITORIAL BY THE PRC'S THREE LEADING PUBLICA-
TIONS IN THE ANTI-TENG CAMPAIGN, COMMEMORATING THE 55TH
ANNIVERSARY OF THE JULY 1 FOUNDING OF THE CHINESE COMMUNIST
PARTY, REFLECTS TENSIONS WITHIN THE LEADERSHIP OVER HOW TO
HANDLE THE CAPITALIST-ROADERS WITHIN THE PARTY. A 1964 MAO
QUOTE IS PRINTED FOR THE FIRST TIME, AND IT IS A POTENTIALLY
CONTENTIOUS ONE. IN A DIRECTIVE CONCERNING THE SOCIALIST
EDUCATION MOVEMENT, A FORERUNNER OF THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION,
MAO CLAIMED THAT THE BUREAUCRATICCLASS AND WORKING CLASS
WERE "SHARPLY ANTAGONISTIC TO EACH OTHER" AND THAT PARTY
CAPITALIST-ROADERS WERE "BOURGEOIS ELEMENTS SUCKING THE BLOOD
OF THE WORKERS." INSTEAD OF CALLING FOR THE OUSTER OF
PRESENT-DAY CAPITALIST-ROADERS, HOWEVER, THE EDITORIAL
STATES THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION TO SOLVE IS THAT OF
LINE, AND IT INVOKES MAO'S DICTUM ON CURING THE SICKNESS
TO SAVE THE PATIENT AS THE PRINCIPLE TO BE APPLIED TO THOSE
COMRADES WHO HAVE MADE MISTAKES. THIS IS THE FIRST USE OF
THAT FORMULATION IN AN EDITORIAL SINCE MARCH 10 (HONG KONG
7746). LIMITED OFFICIAL USE
3. CENTRAL INSTRUCTIONS TO THE PROVINCES ON THE STUDY OF
THE EDITORIAL APPEAR TO HAVE EMPHASIZED MAO'S 1964 DIRECTIVE
ON THE SOCIALIST EDUCATION MOVEMENT. AN ANHWEI BROADCAST
JULY 2 CALLS MAO'S DIRECTIVE THE "CORE OF THE EDITORIAL"
WHILE A KIANGSU BROADCAST OF THE SAME DATE REFERS TO MAO'S
DIRECTIVE AS THE "MOST IMPORTANT THING" IN THE EDITORIAL.
WHILE ONLY TROUBLED CHEKIANG HAS THUS FAR REPEATED THE
EDITORIAL'S FORMULA ON CURING THE SICKNESS TO SAVE THE PATIENT,
SEVERAL HAVE STRESSED STUDY AND CONCENTRATION ON THE CORRECT
LINE AS THE PROPER PLAN FOR ACTION. THUS, WHILE MAO'S 1964
DIRECTIVE COULD BE USED AS A JUSTIFICATION FOR SOME FUTURE
CHANGES IN PROVINCIAL PARTY STRUCTURES, FOR THE MOMENT MOST
PROVINCIAL REACTION HAS PLACED EQUAL EMPHASIS ON THE BLANDER
ASPECTS OF THE EDITORIAL. LIMITED OFFICIAL USE
4. TO PURGE OR NOT TO PURGE . . . .
WHILE THE JOINT EDITORIAL WOUND UP ON A MODERATE NOTE, A
JUNE 30 PEOPLE'S DAILY ARTICLE ON TSINGHUA UNIVERSITY, ALSO
CARRIED IN NCNA, APPEARS TO OFFER UP A BLUEPRINT FOR ACTION
LACKING IN THE EDITORIAL. THE NCNA ITEM STATES THAT
TSINGHUA UNIVERSITY'S PARTY COMMITTEE HAS EXPELLED "RENEGADES,
ENEMY AGENTS AND COUNTERREVOLUTIONARIES" WHILE ADMITTING
INTO THE PARTY ACTIVISTS WHO DARE TO FIGHT THE CAPITALIST-
ROADERS. SIMILARLY, A JULY 2 PEOPLE'S DAILY ARTICLE BY
"LIANG HSIAO" CALLS FOR PURGING ENEMIES WITHIN THE PARTY
AND APPLAUDS THE PARTY'S PAST LAUNCHING OF MASS STRUGGLE.
ON THE OTHER HAND, THE ARTICLE STRIKES A DEFENSIVE NOTE IN
CLAIMING THAT THOSE "GETTING TIRED OF CLASS STRUGGLE" ARE
PLAYING INTO THE HANDS OF THE CAPITALIST-ROADERS AND THAT
THE THEORY OF AN INEVITABLE CAPITALIST RESTORATION "IS
EXTREMELY REACTIONARY" (PEKING 1TLM LIMITED OFFICIAL USE

5. SHANGHAI MEDIA HAVE ALSO ENTERED THE FRAY WITH A WEN
HUI PAO ARTICLE JUNE 28 WHICH APPEARS TO JUSTIFY FACTIONALISM
BY POINTING OUT THAT A GROUP OF PARTY MEMBERS WITH "PROLETARIAN
PARTY CHARACTER" IS NEEDED WHO ARE UNAFRAID TO STRUGGLE
AGAINST CAPITALIST-ROADERS. MEANWHILE, A CHIH HENG ARTICLE
IN THIS MONTH'S RED FLAG ALSO LABORS TO JUSTIFY CLASS STRUGGLE
WITHIN THE PARTY. WHILE REPEATING MAO'S "SAVE THE PATIENT"
FORMULA, CHIH HENG ALSO QUOTES MAO ON PURGES: "A PROLETARIAN
PARTY MUST ALSO GET RID OF THE STALE AND TAKE IN THE FRESH,
FOR ONLY THUS CAN IT BE FULL OF VITALITY. WITHOUT ELIMINATING
WASTE MATTER AND ABSORBING FRESH BLOOD THE PARTY HAS NO VIGOR."
THUS, AS IF IN REACTION TO THE BALANCED TONE OF THE JOINT
EDITORIAL, THE PAST WEEK HAS WITNESSED AN UPSURGE OF LESS
AUTHORITIATIVE ARTICLES CALLING FOR ACTION TO EXPAND CAMPAIGN
TARGETS WITHIN THE QRTY (HONG KONG 7746). LIMITED OFFICIAL USE
6. UNITED STATES
THE AMERICAN BICENTENNIAL CELEBRATION AT USLO WAS ATTENDE
BY FOREIGN TRADE MINISTER LI CHIANG, THE FIRST TIME A PRC
MINISTER HAD ATTENDED A JULY 4 PARTY. FOUR VICE MINISTERS,
INCLUDING WANG HAI-JUNG, ALSO ATTENDED. (PEKING 1203)
OTHER US ITEMS REPORTED BY NCNA DURING THE WEEK WERE PRIMARILY
ON ECONOMIC AND MILITARY ISSUES WITH SHORT ARTICLES ON THE
UNEMPLOYMENT INCREASE DURING JUNE AND SENATE PASSAGE OF THE
PUBLIC DEBT CEILING INCREASE. SLIGHTLY LONGER ITEMS REPORTED
THE PRESIDENT'S SIGNING OF THE FOREIGN MILITARY AID BILL
AND CONGRESSIONAL PASSAGE OF THE MILITARY PROCUREMENT BILL.
IN BOTH ARTICLES, NCNA INDICATED THE NEED FOR THESE INCREASED
EXPENDITURES BECAUSE OF SOVIET MILITARY EXPANSION (NCNA,
JULY 1-4). LIMITED OFFICIAL USE
7. SOVIET UNION
THE FOCUS OF NCNA REPORTING ON THE SOVIETS DURING THE WEEK
WAS EUROPE. NCNA CARRIED EXCERPTS FROM THE JULY 1 DANISH
PROTEST TO THE USSR ON OBSTRUCTION OF DANISH NAVAL EXERCISES,
THEN FOLLOWED UP WITH AN NCNA COMMENTARY ON THE MATTER.
SIMILARLY, NCNA CARRIED A REPORT ON THE FRG RESPONSE TO THE
MAY 22 USSR STATEMENT ON SOVIET-GERMAN RELATIONS (WR 23).
ANOTHER ARTICLE DWELT ON THE "FAILURE" OF THE HELSINKI
CONFERENCE, MAINTAINING THAT THE SOVIETS SINCE THEN HAVE
INCREASED THEIR MILITARY DEPLOYMENT AS WEILL AS INTENSIFIED
THEIR POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC SUBVERSIVE ATTEMPTS AGAINS
WESTERN EUROPE. FOLLOWING UP ON THE AUSTRALIAN PRIME
MINISTER'S RECENT VISIT TO PEKING, AN NCNA CORRESPONDENT'S
ARTICLE MAINTAINED THAT "WE DISLIKE RUSSIA IS A REMARK
FREQUESTLY EXPRESSED IN AUSTRALIA TODAY." TURNING TO AFRICA,
NCNA REPLAYED SOVIET AGGRESSION IN ANGOLA AND SOVIET-EGYPTIAN
DIFFICULTIES AS EVIDENCE THAT THE SOVIETE ARE THE "WICKED
ENEMY" OF THE AFRICAN PEOPLES. FINALLY, A LENGTHY NCNA
CORRESPONDENT ARTICLE CONDEMNED THE SOVIET MILITARY BUILD-UP,
CLAIMING THE SOVIETS HAVE ALREADY OUTSTRIPPED THE USE IN
CONVENTIONAL ARMS AND HAVE CREATED AN "OCEAN-GOING OFFENSIVE.Z
MAINTAINING THAT MOSCOW IS "FOLLOWING IN THE WAKE OF BOTH
TSARIST RUSSIAN IMPERIALISM AND HITLER," THE ARTICLE ENDS BY
ASSERTING THAT SOVIET POLICY IS "OUT AND OUT HEGEMONISM."
(NCNA, JUNE 29-JULY 6) LIMITED OFFICIAL USE
8. COMMUNIST PARTIES
ALTHOUGH THE PRC DOMESTIC MEDIA HAVE REFRAINED FROM MENTIONING
THE EUROPEAN COMMUNIST CONFERENCE, THE LOCAL WEN WEI PAO
JULY 2 COMMENTED THAT THE RESULTS PROVED THE "TOTAL BANK-
RUPTCY OF SOVIET REVISIONIST HEGEMONISM" AMONG THE EUROPEAN
COMMUNIST PARTIES. THE LOCAL PAPERS ALSO NOTED THAT THE
CONFERENCE OPENED WHILE POLISH WORKERS WERE ON STRIKE PRO-
TESTING FOOD PRICE HIKES WHICH WERE ALSO THE SUBJECT OF A
LENGTHY SIGNED NCNA ARTICLE. NCNA INDICATED THAT THE POLISH
WORKERS FORCED WITHDRAWAL OF THE PRICE INCREASES, BUT MAINTAINED
THAT THE SOVIETS THROUGH THEIR PLUNDER OF THE POLISH ECONOMY
BORE THE REAL RESPONSIBILITY. NCNA ALSO CARRIED REPORTS
FROM ALBANIA AND THE FRENCH MARXIST-LENINIST COMMUNIST
PARTY ON THE POLISH STRIKES (NCNA, JULY 3; TA KUNG PAO,
JUNE 28; WEN WEI PAO, JULY 2). LIMITED OFFICIAL USE
9. THE PAUCITY OF SUPPORT FOR THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY,
HOWEVER, HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED BY THE RELATIVELY FEW CON-
GRATULARTROY GREETINGS ON THE 55TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CCP.
THUS FAR, NCNA HAS CARRIED MESSAGES ONLY FROM PARTIES IN
LAOS, THAILAND, BURMA, INDONESIA, MALAYSIA, VIETNAM, ALBANIA,
NORTH KOREA, POLAND (FROM THE RUMP MARXIST-LENINIST GROUP
HEADQUARTERED IN ALBANIA), ROMANIA, GERMANY, AND THE US
OCTOBER LEAGUE. THE BULK OF THE MESSAGES WERE LIMITED TO
PRAISE FOR PRC ACHIEVEMENTS AND FOR CHAIRMAN MAO'S LEADER-
SHIP. UNDOUBTEDLY OF SOME CONCERN TO THE SOUTHEAST ASIAN
COUNTRIES WERE THE COMMENTS INCLUDED IN THE INDONESIAN, THAI,
AND MALAYSIAN GREETINGS. THE RESIDENT INDONESIAN COMMUNIST
IN PEKING, JUSUF ADJITOROP, MAINTAINED THAT THE CCP
"RESOLUTELY SUPPORTS AND ASSISTS THE INDONESIAN COMMUNIST
PARTY AND THE INDONESIAN REVOLUTION," WHICH HE DESCRIBED
AS "FIGHTING FOR THE OVERTHROW OF THE SUHARTO FASCIST
MILITARY DICTATORSHIP WHICH IS A LACKEY OF US IMPERIALISM
AND HAS THE BACKING OF SOVIET SOCIAL-IMPERIALSIM." THE
THAI CENTRAL COMMITTEE INDICATED THEY WOULD CONTINUE FOLLOW-
ING MAO'S MAXIM ON ENCIRCLING THE CITIES AND SEIZING STATE
POWER BY ARMED FORCE. THE MALAYSIANS CLAIMED TO HAVE
"ESTABLISHED CLOSE REVOLUTIONARY UNIT AND A PROFOUND
MILITANT FRIENDSHIP WITH THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHINA AND
THE CHINESE PEOPLE." SUCH COMMENTS CARRIED BY NCNA SHOULD
DO LITTLE TO IMPROVE PRC FORMAL GOVERNMENTAL RELATIONSHIPS
WITH THE COUNTRIES CONCERNED (NCNA, JULY 1-6). LIMITED

AS HIS PREDECESSOR HAS DONE, PREMIER HUA KUO-FENG SENT A
MESSAGE EXTENDING "WARMEST CONGRATULATIONS" ON BEHALF OF THE
CHINESE GOVERNMENT AND PEOPLE TO THE LATEST OAU SUMMIT
SESSION. THE JULY 1 MESSAGE, INTER ALIA, EXPRESSED THE HOPE
THAT THE CURRENT ASSEMBLY WOULD MAKE A NEW CONTRIBUTION TO
FURTHER STRENGTHENING OF AFRICAN "MILITANT UNITY." A JULY 16
NCNA REPORT ON THE CLOSING CEREMONY CITED PORTIONS OF THE
SPEECH FROM THE HOST COUNTRY CHAIRMAN, MAURITIUS PRIME MINISTER
RAMGOOLAM, WHICH TENDED TO PUT A POSITIVE CAST ON THE ASEMBLY
DELIBERATIONS. IT NOTED THAT THE OAU ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
EMPHASIZING INTENSIFIED ARMED STRUGGLE IN AFRICA, STRONGLY
CONDEMNING SOUTH AFRICA FOR THE SOWETO MASSACRES AND THE
ISRAELIS' "WANTON AGGRESSION" AGAINST UGANDA. BUT WITH THE
CHINESE CURRENTLY VIEWING AFRICA UNITY AS THE OPTIMUM MEANS
OF COUNTERING SOVIET INROADS IN AFRICA, PEKING IS UNDOUBTEDLY
DISAPPOINTED WITH THE SUMMIT'S OUTCOME, WHICH DEEPENS RATHER
THAN DIMINISHES DIVISIONS AMONG THE AFRICAN NATIONS AND
BETWEEN AFRICAN AND ARAB COUNTRIES. LIMITED OFFICIAL USE
11. IN CONTRAST WITH THE SILENCE OF PRC DOMESTIC NEWS
ORGANS ON RECENT EVENTS IN UGANDA, HONG KONG'S COMMUNIST
PRESS HAS CARRIED A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF WIRE SERVICE
REPORTS ON THE ISRAELI RESCUE OF HOSTAGES BEING HELD BY
THE PALESTINIAN HIJACKERS. A JULY 6 WEN WEI PAO COMMENTARY
SHARPLY DENOUNCED THE ISRAELI RESCUE AS AN "ACT OF AGGRESSION."
IT DECLARED THAT EACH COUNTRY HAS THE RIGHT TO HANDLE
HIJACKERS IN ITS OWN WAY. ISRAELI ASSERTIONS THAT THEIR
ACTION WAS "REASONABLE AGGRESSION" WERE TERMED "PIRATE'S
LOGIC." THE COMMENTARY CONCLUDED BY LINKING THE ISRAELIS'
DECISION TO UNDERTAKE AN ACTION THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY FROM
HOME WITH SUPPORT FROM THE TWO SUPERPOWERS.
12. FINALLY, DURING THE WEEK NCNA CARRIED TWO REPORTS ON
THE FAILURE OF THE MILITARY COUP AGAINST THE SUDANESE
PRESIDENT NIMERI. THE BRIEF NEWS REPORTS AVOIDED MENTIONING
LIBYA BY NAME, BUT DID CITE PRESIDENT NIMERI'S CHARGES OF
FOREIGN AGGRESSION AND INVOLVEMENT IN THE COUP ATTEMPT
(HONG KONG 7882 AND NCNA, JULY 6). LIMITED OFFICIAL USE
13. VIETNAMESE REUNIFICATION
CHINA'S RESPONSE TO EVENTS ASSOCIATED WITH VIETNAM'S OFFICIAL
REUNIFICATION HAS HIGHLIGHTED THE COOL BUT CORRECT RELATION-
SHIP BETWEEN PEKING AND HANOI. PRC MEDIA ON JULY 3 CARRIED
THE TEXT OF A JOINT CONGRATULATORY MESSAGE FROM CHAIRMAN MAO,
NPC CHAIRMAN CHU TEH AND PREMIER HUA KUO-FENG TO THE NEWLY
ELECTED VIETNAMESE PARTY AND GOVERNMENT LEADERS. THE RATHER
LUKEWARM MESSAGE AND A SUBSEQUENT JULY 4 PEOPLE'S DAILY
EDITORIAL FAILS TO MENTION FRATERNAL FRIENDSHIP, GOVERNMENT-
TO-GOVERNMENT TIES, OR PARTY-TO-PARTY SUPPORT. ALTHOUGH
SOMEWHAT WARMER IN TONE, THE EDITORIAL MERELY STATES THAT
THE CHINESE PEOPLE SHARE THE JOY OF THE VIETNAMESE PEOPLE
AND EXTEND CONGRATULATIONS. NCNA HAS ALSO REPORTED THE
MEETING OF FONMIN CHIAO KUAN-HUA WITH THE VIETNAMESE AMBASSADOR
TO PEKING. THE AMBASSADOR PRESENTED AN OFFICIAL NOTE INFORM-
ING CHINA OF THE NEW SOCIALIST REPUBLIC'S DESIRE TO CONTINUE
DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH THE PRC IN PLACE OF THE TWO PREVIOUS
VIETNAMESE EMBASSIES. LATER, ON JULY 6, FOREIGN TRADE
MINISTER LI CHIANG WAS THE RANKING PRC OFFICIAL ON HAND AT
A FILM RECEPTION HOSTED BY THE VIETNAMESE AMBASSADOR TO MARK
VIETNAM'S REUNIFICATION (HONG KONG 7873 AND NCNA, JULY 6).

** 147708 1976NASSAU01075 0.007103217 | 1976-07-06 | NASSAU | STATE | BAHAMIAN VIEWS ON ISRAELI COMMANDO RAID
1.  WHEN FOLLOWING THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION OF 1842,
MILLARD FILLMORE WAS AWAKENED BY HIS SERVANT WITH THE
ANNOUNCEMENT, "I HAVE THE HONOR TO TELL YOU THAT YOU
HAVE BEEN NOMINATED FOR THE OFFICE OF VICE PRESIDENT,
AS RIDICULOUS AS THAT MAY SEEM," FILLMORE MAY WELL
HAVE REACTED AS YOU MIGHT WHEN I SUGGEST THAT BAHAMIAN
VIEWS ON THE RECENT ISRAELI COMMANDO RAID MAY BE OF
INTEREST AS YOU CONSIDER FORMULATING U.S. POLICY IN
ANTICIPATION OF A POSSIBLE UN SECURITY COUNCIL DEBATE
ON THE SUBJECT.
2.  NORMALLY, I WOULD NOT THINK OF BURDENING YOU WITH
THE VIEWS OF THIS VERY SMALL REPUBLIC WHICH OBVIOUSLY
CARRIES LITTLE WEIGHT IN WORLD COUNCILS.  THAT I NEVER-
THELESS DO SO IS AN INDICATION THAT I THINK YOU MAY
FIND SOMETHING OF UNUSUAL INTEREST IN THE REACTION OF
THIS SMALL, BLACK RULED NATION LIVING ON OUR DOORSTEP.  IN
THIS CONNECTION, IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT WHILE FRIENDLY TO
THE U.S. THE BAHAMAS HAS BEEN TRYING TO CARVE OUT A SOMEWHAT
MORE NON-ALIGNED POSTURE, AT LEAST IN APPEARANCE IF NOT
REALITY.  FOR EXAMPLE, IT HAS HOSTED SEVERAL BLACK AFRICAN
HEADS OF STATE IN THE PAST YEAR AND PRIME MINISTER PINDLING
HAS SPOKEN OUT IN CRITICAL TERMS CONCERNING U.S. POLICY
TOWARD SOUTH AFRICA AND RHODESIA.  (HE WAS, HOWEVER, MOST
FAVORABLY IMPRESSED WITH YOUR KAMPALA SPEECH.)  IN ANY
EVENT, I WAS INTERESTED IN SEEING HOW PINDLING REACTED TO
THE RECENT ISRAELI RAID.
3.  AT A SOCIAL EVENT ON SUNDAY, I WAS SEATED WITH THE PRIME
MINISTER AND ASKED HIS REACTION.  HE HAD JUST RETURNED
FROM A SEVERAL DAY TRIP TO THE OUT ISLANDS AND HAD NOT HEARD
OF THE ISRAELI ACTION.  I DESCRIBED WHAT HAD BEEN BROADCAST
ON THE NEWS.  PINDLING WAS OBVIOUSLY SURPRISED BUT, SOMEWHAT
TO MY OWN SURPRISE, REACTED WITH UNDISGUISED ADMIRATION AND
APPROBATION.  HE SAID "IT WAS ABOUT TIME SOMEONE TOOK SUCH
AN ACTION."  WHEN I REMARKED THAT AMIN WAS FUMING, HE SAID
"OF COURSE, WHAT ELSE COULD ONE EXPECT FROM AMIN?"
4.  PINDLING'S REACTION IS ONE WHICH I SENSE IS GENERALLY
SHARED.  THESE ARE DECENT PEOPLE OUTRAGED BY THE ACTS OF
TERRORISTS AND THEY SUFFER A FRUSTRATION, ONCE REMOVED,
ABOUT THE APPARENT INABILITY OF THE "GOOD GUYS" TO REACT.
5.  IF THIS IS AT ALL GERMANE TO THE FORMULATION OF
OUR UN SECURITY COUNCIL POSITION, IT IS THAT WE WILL BE
CLOSELY WATCHED TO SEE HOW WE REACT.  IF WE REACT TIMIDLY
IN WHAT APPEARS TO BE AN ATTEMPT TO BALANCE OUR POSITION SO
AS TO AVOID GIVING OFFENSE TO THE AFRICANS OR THE ARABS,
WE WILL DISAPPOINT THOSE WHO LOOK TO US FOR STAUNCH LEADER-
SHIP IN SUCH MATTERS.  CONVERSELY, IF OUR POSITION FOLLOWS
UP THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE OF CONGRATULATIONS TO THE ISRAELIS
WITH AN INDICATION THAT WE OURSELVES WILL NO LONGER TOLERATE
TERRORISTS BEING ACCORDED SANCTUARIES THUS PERMITTING THESE
VILE INTERNATIONAL OUTLAWS THE PROTECTION OF THE AMINS AND
QUADAFFIS OF THIS WORLD, I BELIEVE WE SHALL BE APPLAUDED
FOR OUR STAND.  AND INDEED, EVEN IF WE ARE NOT, A CASE
COULD WELL BE MADE THAT THE TIME IS LONG OVERDUE FOR US TO
ADOPT PRECISELY SUCH A POSTURE.

 * 75237 1976GENEVA05293 0.00710166 | 1976-07-06 | GENEVA | STATE | UNDP 22ND GOVERNING COUNCIL - FINAL SESSION
1.  SUMMARY:  THE DRAFT REPORT OF 22ND SESSION OF
UNDP GOVERNING COUNCIL WAS ADOPTED AT 6:30 P.M. 5 JULY
AFTER FOUR HOURS OF DEBATE THAT WAS MARKED BY: 1)
A RESERVATION BY THE ISRAELI OBSERVER POINTING OUT THAT
UNDER THE PARTICIPANT FORMULA PROPOSED FOR THE
TECHNICAL COOPERAION AMONG DEVELOPING COUNTRIES WORLD
CONFERENCE (WHICH WAS THE PARTICIPANT FORMULA USED FOR
THE RECENT HABITANT CONFERENCE) THE PLO WOULD BE
PERMITTED TO ATTEND AND TTO ONCE AGAIN JEOPARDIZE
THE WORK OF AN IMPORTANT WORLD CONFERENCE; 2) AN HOUR
LONG SERIES OF BITTER PRRC-USSR EXCHANGES CONCERNING
WORLD WIDE AGGRESSION, ARMS BUILD-UPS, GROWING
THREATS OF A THIRD WORLD WAR, WHO IS THE REAL FRIEND
OF THE THIRD WORLD, REJECTIONS OF ONE ANOTHERS SLANDEROUS
STATEMENTS, ETC.; AND 3) AN EXTREMELY ADROIT, IMPARTIAL
PRESIDING JOB BY COUNCIL PRESIDENT ALARCON WHICH WAS
LARGELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COUNCIL ADJOURNING ON
SCHEDULE AMID A FLURRY OF EFFUSIVE PRAISE FOR
SESSIONAL OFFICERS, THE SECRETARIAT AND UNDP
ADMINISTRATOR MORSE.  END SUMMARY
2.  FINAL SESSION OF 22ND GOVERNING COUNCIL JULY 5
FIRST TOOK UP THE 20 PAGE REPORT (DP/L 311 REV 1)
OF TCDC COMMITTED WHICH WITH NUMEROUS NON-SUBSTATIVES
CHANGES WWAS APPROVED WITHOUT DEBATE.
3.  FOLLOWING APPROVAL OF THE TCDC REPORT AN ISRAELI OBSSERVER
(WHO WAS MAKING HIS FIRST APPEARANCE IN PLENARY, HAD
ATTENDED NONE OF THE FIVE TCDC COMMITTEE MEETINGS
AND WHO WHEN HE HAD INTROUDUCED HIMSELF TO THE US DEL
MINUTES BEFORE-TO FIND OUT THE STATUS OF THE HAVANA
UNDP GC VENUE ISSUE-HAD NOT INDICATED HE PLANNED TO
SPEAK) RECORDED IN A STRAIGHT-FORWARD MANNER GOOI
OPPOSITION TO EXPECTED PARTICIPATION BY THE PALESTINE
LIBERATION ORGANIZATION (PLO) IN THE WORLD CONFERENCE
ON TECHNICAL COOPERAION AMONG DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
SCHEDULED FOR BUENOS AIRES IN AUGUST 1977.  REBUTTAL
STATEMENTS WERE MADE BY KUWAIT
WHICH RECALLED GA RESOLUTIONS AND
ACCUSED ISRAEL OF SEEKING TO DESTROY PLO AND THE NATIONAL
IDENTITY OF PALESTINIAN PEOPLE; BY PRC WHICH EXPRESSED
"INDIGNATION" AT ATTACK ON PLO; AND BY USSR WHICH DEFENDED
PLO AS A TRUE LIBERATION MOVEMENT WITH THE RIIGHT TO
PURSUE ITS "STRUGGLE" IN ALL UN BODIES.  CURIOUSLY,
NO SPEAKER REFERRED TO AUDACIOUS ISRAELI RESCUE OF
HIJACKING HOSTAGES IN UGANDA REPORTED EXTENSIVELY
IN MORNIING PRESS.  IT SHOULD ALSO BE NOTED THAT PRIOR
TO THE ISRAELI INTERVENTION THERE HAD BEEN NO MENTION IN
ANY OF THE FIVE TCDC COMMITTEE MEETINGS OF THE PLO
EITHER IN CONNECTION WITH ITS POSSIBLE PARTICIPATION
AT THE WORLD CONFERENCE (SEE PARRA 15 OF DP/202 OF
7 MAY) OR OTHERWISE.
4.  DESPITE COUNCIL PRESIDENT ALARCON'S REQUEST THAT
ALL MEMBERS REFRAIN FROM REOPENING EARLIER DEBATES
DURING CONSIDERATION OF REPORT, USSR AND PRC FOR
THE THIRD SUCCESSIVE FINAL MEETING OF A UNDP GOVERNING
COUNCIL ENGAGED IN THEIR NOW FAMILIAR BOUT OF POLEMICS.
WITH INJURED INNOCENCE, USSR ACCUSED PRC OF
SLANDER AND A CONTINUING FAILURE TO MAKE ANY CONSTRUCTIVE
CONTRIBUTION TO EITHER THE UNDP COUNCIL OR THE UN IN
GENERAL.  PRC WITH RISING INVECTIVE PURSUDE ITS ATTACK
AT LENGTH SIX INTERVENTIONS UNTIL ALARCON WARNED THE COUNCIL OF THE
FINANCIAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE CONSEQUENCES IF SESSION
SPILLED OVER UNTIL JULY 6.  FOLLOWING A BRIEF
ADJOURNMENT AND AIDED BY RAPPORTEUR GHOSE (INDIA),
A COMPROMISE WAS REACHED (SIMILAR TO THE COMPROMISE
REACHED AT THE 21ST SESSION) WHICH PROVIDED FOR ONE
SHORT, FAIRLY BLAND, PARAGRAPH SUMMARIZING THE VIEWS OF
EACH SIDE BEING INCLUDED IN THE REPORT ( THE CHINESE
SUCCESSFULLY INSISTED THE RUSSIANS DROP THE PHRASE
"AND THE STRENGTHENING OF DETENTE" FROM ITS PARAGRAPH)
AND A FOOTNOTE IN THE REPORT THAT STATES "FOR  FURTHER DETAILS
SEE UNDP GC SUMMARY RECORDS 522,527 AND 543."
5.  SESSION ENDED ON UPBEAT AND EVEN SENTIMENTAL
NOTE WITH GUSH OF PRAISE FOR ALARCON, FIRST VICE
PRESIDENT AMB. HEDEMANN (NORWAY), SECOND VICE
PRESIDENT AMB. SALIFOU (NIGER) THIRD VICE PRESIDENT
CZARKOWSKI (POLAND), RAPPORTEUR GHOSE (INDIA) AND ADMINISTRATOR
MORSE.  SINCERE EXPRESSIONS OF FAREWELL OFFERED TO
MISS GHOSE WHO LIKE HEDEMANN AND SALIFOU BECAUSE OF
TRANSERES WOULD BE TERMINATING THEIR ASSOCIATION WITH
UNDP GC SESSIONS.
6.  CHIEFLY VIA THE MECHANISM OF CONSULTATIONS WITH
THE RAPPORTEUR HELD JUST BEFORE THE FINAL MEETING
COMMENCED, THE US DELEGATION WAS ABLE SUCCESSFULLY
AND WITHOUT CONTROVERY TO GET APPROXIMATELY TEN
SMALL "BALANCING" AMENDMENTS INCORPORATED INTO THE
FINAL REPORT OF THE SESSION.DALE

** 49519 1976CAIRO09128 0.007101057 | 1976-07-06 | CAIRO | STATE | FAHMY ON ISRAELI ACTION IN ENTEBBE
1. AT ALEXANDRIA, JULY 5, FAHMY SPOKE SCATHINGLY OF
"ISRAELI AGGRESSION" AGAINST UGANDA IN RELEASING THE
HOSTAGES. HE HAD PUBLICLY CONDEMNED THE OPERATION AS
"THEATRICAL". IT WAS WORSE THAN THAT. UN SYG WALDHEIM HAD CONDEMNED
IT AS CONTRARY UNCHARTER. THE WHOLE
MATTER COULD HAVE BEEN NEGOTIATED WITH THE TERRORISTS.
HANNI EL-HASSAN HAD BEEN SENT BY SPECIAL EGYPTIAN
MILITARY PLANE TO ASSIST. PRESIDENT FORD'S STATEMENT
ON THE SUBJECT HAD BEEN UNHELPFUL AND FAHMY CLAIMED
HE IS UNDER INTENSE PRESSURE TO MAKE A PUBLIC STATEMENT
TO DENOUNCE THE FORD STATEMENT.
2. I TOLD FAHMY THAT WE HAD NOT IN ANY WAY BEEN INVOLVED
IN THE OPERATION AND THAT THE ISRAELIS HAD NOT INFORMED
US IN ADVANCE OF IT. I WAS SURE, HOWEVER, THAT
PRESIDENT FORD'S STATEMENT REFLECTED THE VIEWS OF
MOST AMERICANS.WE APPRECIATED GOE EFFORTS TO
SOLCIT PLO SUPPORT AND THE DISPATCH OF HANNI EL-HASSAN
TO ENTEBBE, BUT IT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT HANNI
EL-HASSAN HAD NOT BEEN ALLOWED TO LAND. FAHMY CORRECTED
THIS. EL-HASSAN HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO LAND, BUT
IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS ORDERED TO LEAVE. FAHMY WAS
NOT SURE WHETHER THE ORDERS HAD COME FROM THE UGANDAN
GOVERNMENT OR THE TERRIORISTS. I POINTED OUT THAT,
WHOEVER GAVE THE ORDERS, THAT PARTICULAR NEGITATING
EFFORT DID NOT SEEM TO BE WORKING. THIS LEFT THE
SOMALI AMBASSADOR, AND I ASKED IF HE WOULD HAVE ANY
CONFIDENCE IN A SIMALI AMBASSADOR NEGOTIATING IN HIS
BEHALF IN CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH AS THOSE WHICH PREVAILED.
FAHMY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE WOULD NOT.
3. I TOLD HIM HE HAD TO DECIDE WHETHER TO MAKE ANOTHER
STATEMENT, BUT HE SHOULD KNOW THAT ANY SUCH STATEMENT
WILL SIT POORLY WITH AMERICAN CONGRESSIONAL AND PUBLIC
OPINION. I UNDERSTOOD WHY, IN AN OAU CONTEXT, HE HAD
TO MAKE A PUBLIC STATEMENT CONDEMNING THE ISRAELI
OPERATION, BUT SUGGESTED HE CONSIDER WHETHER THAT
STATEMENT MIGHT NOT SUFFICE. FAHMY SAID HE WILL TRY
TO AVOID ANY PUBLIC REFERENCE TO PRESIDENT FORD'S
PERTINENT MESSAGE TO ISRAEL, BUT INSISTED OAU PRESSURE
IS INTENSE. THE OAU WILL CERTAINLY CONDEMN THE ISRAELI
ACTION AND PERHAPS CALL FOR A UNSC MEETING TO DO THE
SAME. EGYPTIANS WILL SUPPORT ANY SUCH EFFORT.

** 82334 1976HONGK07882 0.007100737 | 1976-07-07 | HONG KONG | STATE | HONG KONG COMMUNIST PRESS DENOUNCES ISRAELI RESCUE OF HOSTAGES IN  UGANDA
OF HOSTAGES IN UGANDA
1. ALTHOUGH NCNA HAS CARRIED TWO NEWS ITEMS ON THE ATTEMPTED
COUP IN THE SUDAN, PRC DOMESTIC MEDIA ORGANS HAVE YET TO MENTION
THE ISRAELI RESCUE OF HOSTAGES HELD BY PALESTINIAN HIJACKERS
IN UGANDA. PRC-OWNED NEWSPAPER IN HONG KONG, HOWEVER, HAVE DE-
VOTED CONSIDERABLE SPACE TO FOREIGN WIRE SERVICE REPORTS OF
EVENTS IN UGANDA AS WELL AS THE UGANDAN AND AFRICAN REACTIONS
TO THE ISRAELI RESCUE OF THE HOSTAGES.
2. A JULY 6 COMMENTARY IN THE PRC-OWNED WEN WEI PAO HAS SHARPLY
DENOUNCED THE ISRAELI ACTION AS AN "ACT OF AGGRESSION". IT
NOTES THAT THE ISRAELI ACTION RESULTED IN THE DEATH OF UGANDAN
SOLIDERS AND DESTRUCTION OF MORE THAN TEN PLANES AT THE AIRFIELD
AND ASSERTS THAT SUCH ACTION WILL CERTAINLY GIVE RISE TO
WIDESPREAD CRITICISM.
3. THE COMMENTARY MAINTAINS THAT THE WORLD'S REVOLUTIONARY
PEOPLES SUPPORT RESTORATION OF THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE'S
RIGHTS TO THEIR HOMELAND, BUT IT CAREFULLY REFRAINS FROM CONDON-
ING THE HIJACKING, POINTEDLY NOTING THAT PEOPLE DO NOT CONSIDER
THIS TYPE OF "STRUGGLE" WORTHY OF SUPPORT. AT THE SAME TIME,
IT REJECTS ISRAELI CONTENTIONS THAT UNGANDAN AUTHORITIES WERE
ASSISTING THE HIJACKING AND NOTES UGANDAN ASSERTIONS OF CONCERN
FOR THE SAFETY OF THE HOSTAGES. MAINTAININGTHATEACH COUNTRY
HAS THE RIGHT TO HANDLE HIJACKERS IN ITS OWN WAY, THE COMMENTRAY
DENOUNCES THE ISREALI ASSERTION THAT THE ACTION WAS ONE OF
"REASONABLE AGGRESSION" AS "PIRATE'S LOGIC". IF SUCH LOGIC
WERE ACCEPTED, THE COMMENTARY ADDS, THEN ANY COUNTRY INVOLVED
IN HIJACKING COULD BE SUBJECT TO A MILITARY ATTACK.
4. THE COMMENTARY CONCLUDES BY RAISING THE SPECTRE OF THE
SUPERPOWERS. THAT SUCH A SMALL COUNTRY AS ISRARL WAS EMBOLDENED
TO UNDERTAKE SUCH AN ACTION THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY FROM HOME IS
ATTRIBUTED TO (1) US SUPPORT FOR ISREAL AND (2) INCREASING
YET SECRET ASSISTANCE RENDERED BY THE SOVIETS.

 * 252132 1976STATE166467 0.007100678 | 1976-07-03 | STATE | SECRETARY | TALK WITH JUMBLATT JULY 1
SUMMARY: JUMBLATT SPOKE FOR ALMOST 2 HOURS WITH ME ON WIDE
RANGE OF SUBJECTS. HE OUTLINED THE "SINS" OF THE CHRISTIANS AND
THE NEED TO REALIZE HOW MUCH THEY HAD TO LOSE IN SPECIFIC TERMS
FROM THEIR CURRENT ALLIANCE WITH THE SYRIANS.  HE ATTACKED
SYRIAN POLICY AND THOUGHT THE FIRST STEP IS THAT SYRIANS GET OUT
BEFORE A ROUND TABLE DISCUSSION CAN PROCEED.  HE WAS
GENERALLY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT CHANCES OF ENDING THE FIGHTING IN THE
NEAR FUTURE (THOUGH GIVING NO SPECIFIC EVIDENCE OF THIS BEYOND
THE GENERAL FEELING THAT "PEOPLE NEED A REST"), AND SAID TIME HAD
COME FOR COMPROMISE. HOWEVER, ROUND TABLE DISCUSSIONS MUST
BE CAREFULLY PREPARED, AND GAVE AS AN EXAMPLE TALKS HE AND THE
PALESTINIANS HAVE HAD WITH BASHIR GEMAYEL, SON OF PIERRE
GEMAYEL. HE OUTLINED SOME REFORMS, INCLUDING PROPORTIONAL
REPRESENTATION AND DE-CONFESSIONALIZATION OF THE STATE, AS
EXAMPLES OVER WHICH COMPROMISE CAN BE REACHED. THOUGH
RESTED AND SPEAKING IN REASONABLE TERMS, HE WAS NOT VERY
CONVINCING THAT PEACE IS AROUND THE CORNER.  END SUMMARY.
1.  I TOOK LAMBRADIS WITH ME TO CALL ON JUMBLATT JULY 1.  HE
LOOKED RESTED AFTER SOMETIME IN HIS MOUNTAIN RETREAT, WHERE
HE WAS NOT VERY INVOLVED WITH CURRENT POLITICS OVER THE PAST
WEEK OR SO.  HE WAS WELL-DRESSED, HAD A NEAT HAIRCUT, AND
GENERALLY PRESENTED A VERY RELAXED IMAGE AS HE OFFERED US
FRUIT AND DEVOURED IT HIMSELF, AS IS HIS AFTERNOON HABIT.
2.  NOTING THAT HE HAD NEVER MET AMBASSADOR MELOY
PERSONALLY, HE BEGAN WITH EXPRESSIONS OF PERSONAL SORROW AT
THE DEATH OF ROBERT WARING.  HE HAD CONSIDERED HIM AN
HONEST FRIEND AND HAD NOTED THINGS HE HAD DISCUSSED WITH
WARING WERE LISTENED TO IN WASHINGTON, SINCE HE HAD SEEN
PLAYBACKS OF THEM A FEW DAYS LATER IN PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS
OR PRESS REPORTS.  WHEN ASKED FOR HIS CURRENT BEST
ESTIMATE OF WHO THE MURDERERS WERE, JUMBLATT SAID HE
THOUGHT THE MURDERS HAD BEEN ORDERED BY DR. HADDAD, WHO
IS GEORGE HABASH'S DEPUTY IN THE PFLP.  HE SAID HE HAD
NOT BEEN IN TOUCH MORE RECENTLY WITH SPECIFICS OF THE
INVESTIGATION, BUT WOULD LOOK INTO IT FOR US.  I PRESSED HIM
ON THIS SCORE, AND HE SEEMED COMPLETELY WILLING TO DO WHAT
HE COULD.  HE NOTED HIS OWN SISTER'S DEATH AND THE WOUNDING
OF HIS NIECES.  SUCH PERSONAL GRIEF HELPS ONE APPRECIATE
THE GRIEF OF OTHERS, HE SAID.
3.  I EXPLAINED MY MISSION TO THE LEBANON, AND NOTED THAT IN
EARLIER CONVERSATIONS SINCE MY ARRIVAL CERTAIN SUGGESTIONS HAD
COME UP ON WHICH I HAD CONSISTENTLY TRIED TO SET THE RECORD
STRAIGHT.  I HAVE BEEN POINTING OUT THAT THE US IS AGAINST
LEBANESE PARTITION.  I HAVE MADE A POINT OF MENTIONING UNITY
OF LEBANON IN MY PUBLIC UTTERANCES.  I ALSO HAVE TRIED TO DEBUNK
LIES SUGGESTING THERE IS A SYRIAN-ISRAELI-CHRISTIAN-USG
CONSPIRACY TO SUPPRESS THE PALESTINIAN AND THE LEFT IN LEBANON.
I NOTED THAT THE PRESS AND RADIO NEVERTHELESS CONTINUED TO INSIST
ON THIS THEME DESPITE ANYTHING THE USG OR I CAN SAY.  JUMBLATT
NODDED HIS UNDERSTANDING.
4.  JUMBLATT ADVERTED INDIRECTLY TO US-SYRIAN COLLUSION.  HE
SAID HE BELIEVED US WHEN WE SAY WE ARE AGAINST PARTITION.
HOWEVER, US USED TO BE VERY STRICT ON QUESTION OF THE
INDEPENDENCE OF LEBANON.  THIS CAME UP IN 1958 EVEN IN
CONNECTION WITH US FACILITATING THE ELECTION OF GENERAL CHEHAB.
ISRAEL HAD BEEN WELL AWARE OVER THE YEARS OF US SUPPORT FOR
LEBANESE INDEPENDENCE.  HOWEVER, THERE HAVE BEEN SOME
CURIOUS EVENTS RECENTLY IN SYRIA.  ASSAD HAS "TURNED COSSACK"
AGAINST THE SOVIETS.  HE HAS RENEWED UNDOF MANDATE ON
GOLAN HEIGHTS WITHOUT ANY FUSS.  ONE CANNOT ESCAPE THE
CONCLUSION THAT US PERMISSION HAS BEEN GIVEN TO SYRIANS TOH
TO VERY FAR INDEED.  EVERYONE BELIEVES THIS, AND JUMBLATT
HAD TOLD THIS TO AMBASSADOR BROWNN WHO HE SAID OF COURSE
DENIED IT.  ONE CANNOT IMAGINE THE SYRIANS WOULD DARE ALLOW
THEIR TROOPS TO ENTER LEBANON WITHOUT SOME KIND OF US
GO-AHEAD. THIS IS A "PLOT" OF WHICH EDDE HAS BEEN TALKING
FOR A YEAR AND A HALF.
6.  JUMBLATT SAID HE BELIEVED SECRETARY KISSINGER HAS A
METHOD WHICH JUMBALTT ADMIRES IN ITS TACTICAL EFFICACY.  IT LETS
PEOPLE FIGHT EACH OTHER UNTIL THEY ARE TIRED AND THEN KISSINGER
STEPS IN WITH A SOLUTION.  BUT US SHOULD BE CAREFUL NOT TO LOSE
ITS FRIENDS IN THE LEBANON.  A SOCIALIST STATE MIGHT RISE IN THE
LEBANON OVER THE NEXT 2 TO 4 YEARS. (IN REPLY TO MY QUESTION,
JUMBLATT INSISTED HE WAS SPEAKING ABOUT A SOCIALIST STATE, NOT
A COMMUNIST.)
7.  SOCIAL REFORM HAD BECOME NECESSARY TO COUNTER MARONITE
PRIVILEGE, WHICH IS EXERCISED IN TERMS REMINISCENT OF THE
MIDDLE AGES.  FIVE PROPRIETORS OWN MOST OF THE BEKAA.  THERE
ARE UNCULTIVATED LANDS GOING TO WASTE WHILE HUNDREDS AND
THOUSANDS ARE MISERABLE IN THEIR POVERTY.  THE COUNTRY NEEDS
TRUE DEMOCRACY.  PROGRESSIVE FORCES WHICH JUMBLATT LEADS
BELIEVE IN LIBERTY.  THEY DO NOT BELIEVE IN COMMUNISM, NOR
CLASS WARFARE, OR IN COUPS D'ETAT.  HE CLAIMED ALONG THAT
LINE TO HAVE PREVENTED GENERAL AHDAB FROM MARCHING AGAINST
FRANGIE WHEN FRANGIE DID NOT RESIGN IN MARCH.  THIS WAS NOT
THE DEMOCRATIC WAY, JUMBLATT SAID.  (AS WE RECALL IT,
JUMBLATT'S GROUP MAY HAVE HAD A PART IN THIS, BUT IT IS FAR
FROM CLEAR THAT HE ALONE PREVENTED AHDAB FROM MARCHING.)
8.  THE MARONITES MUST UNDERSTAND THAT OPPOSITION TO THEM CAN
CONTINUE FOR YEARS IF THEY DO NOT YIELD.  JUMBLATT IS PREPARED
TO DISCUSS THINGS OVER THE ROUND TABLE, BUT NOT TO CONTINUE
ACCEPTING MARONITE MASTERY OF THE COUNTRY.  MARONITES HAVE
SEVERAL SPECIFIC THINGS THEY SHOULD THINK ABOUT: FIRST, IT IS
NOT CLEAR HOW FAR COMMUNISTS MIGHT GO IN LEBANON.
JUMBLATT SAID HE DID NOT LIKE THE COMMUNISTS HIMSELF (AND IN
FACT EXPECTS GREATER DEMOCRATIZATION IN THE SOVIET UNION BY
ABOUT 1985).  HOWEVER, MARONITES SHOULD FEAR COMMUNIST
TREND IN LEBANON IF CONDITIONS ON WHICH THEY BREED ARE NOT
CHANGED.  SECOND, MARONITES SHOULD FEAR EMIGRATION OF THEIR
OWN PEOPLE IF THEY MAINTAIN CURRENT SEPARATENESS BEHIND
THEIR GUNS.  JUMBLATT WAS TOLD 80 PERCENT OF DOCTORS HAVE
ALREADY FLED THE COUNTRY.  THESE STUBBORN
MARONITES MAY SOME DAY FIND THEIR NUMBERS
SO REDUCED THAT THEY WILL BE FACED BY A CRUSHING
MAJORITY OF ISLAM.  THIRD, MARONITES SHOULD FEAR SYRIA.
SOME SUCH AS BASHIR GEMAYEL WISELY OPPOSED SYRIAN
INTERVENTION FOR THIS REASON; OTHERS -- PARTICULARLY THE
MONKS AND CLERICS OF THE CATHOLIC FRONT -- MAINTAIN THEIR
HOPES FOR A NEW CRUSADE.  SYRIANS BELIEVE THEY HAVE A CHANCE
TO REPLACE MOTHER FRANCE AS PROTECTOR OF LEBANON, AND IN
PARTICULAR THE MARONITES.  BUT ONE DAY THERE COULD BE A CHANGE
OF REGIME IN SYRIA WITH SUNNIS OVERTHROWING THE REGIME AND
LIVING UP THEIR FORCES IN LEBANON WITH THE LEFT.  TOP
CHRISTIAN LEADERS SHOULD REALIZE THIS.  (COMMENTING
SPECIFICALLY ON GEMAYEL, JUMBLATT SAID HE SUFFERED FROM
HALLUCINATIONS AND HAD NO INTELLECTUAL BAGGAGE.  CLINICALLY HIS
FATHER HAD SUFFERED FROM HALLUCINATIONS.)
9.  FINALLY, CHRISTIANS SHOULD REALIZE FORTUNE THEY MADE IN
THE PAST WAS BASED ON EXPLOITATION OF ARAB OIL AND SERVICES TO
OTHER ARAB COUNTRIES.  MARONITES HAVE LOST MUCH OF THIS
MONEY (HE SPOKE OF 50,000 LEBANESE IN FRANCE, MANY OF
THEM IN FINANCIAL NEED AT PRESENT).  MARONITES MUST REALIZE
THAT THESE ARAB STATES WILL TURN AGAINST EHEM AND ISOLATE
THEM IF THEY CONTINUE TO BEHAVE AS THEY DO.  JUMBLATT
HIMSELF HAD TO INTERVENE SOME MONTHS AGO FOR FRIENDS WHO WERE
ABOUT TO BE EXPELLED FROM LIBYA AND KUWAIT.
10.  TROUBLE WITH MARONITES, JUMBLATT SUMMED UP, IS THAT THEY
ARE OBSESSED BY FEAR.  SARKIS MAY TURN OUT TO BE THE LAST
MARONITE PRESIDENT OF LEBANON.  THEY MADE A BIG MISTAKE IN
CURRENT ATTACK ON TELL ZAATAR, WHICH HE WAS SORRY TO SEE
BASHIR GEMAYEL ALSO JOINED IN ON FINALLY.  MUSLIMS COULD HAVE
DONE NASTY THINGS TO CHRISTIAN VILLAGES SUCH AS DEIR EL-QAMAR
(IN THE CHOUF), BUT THEY WOULD NOT.  NOR WOULD MUSLIMS ATTACK
CHRISTIANS IN RAS BEIRUT, AS MANY SEEMED TO FEAR.  MARONITES
MUST HAVE CONFIDENCE IN DEMOCRACY AND ACCEPT WESTERNIZING
THE COUNTRY INSTITUTIONS.  BY THIS HE MEANT REFORMS TO SUPPRESS
SECTARIANISM AND ESTABLISH GOVERNMENT ON MODERN PRINCIPLES.
11.  I ASKED HIM IF HE HAD NOT ACCEPTED THE COMPROMISE AGREEMENT
ANNOUNCED LAST FEBRUARY BY FRANGIE.  JUMBLATT SAID THOSE POINTS
HAD BEEN ACCEPTABLE THEN, BUT CHRISTIANS HAD REJECTED THEM, AND
SITUATION HAS CHANGED.  THE LEFT ALLIANCES PARTIES WILL NO LONGER
ACCEPT THEM.  IN THIS SENSE MARONITES ARE ARABS, AND HAVE BEEN
ACTING AS ARABS HAVE ACTED HISTORICALLY TOWARDS ISRAEL --
THEY ACCEPT NOTHING UNTIL IT IS TOO LATE.
12.  COURSE AHEAD, JUMBLATT SAID, MUST BE TO PREPARE A
COMPROMISE AGREEMENT.  THIS MUST BE PRECEDED BY NEGOTIATIONS
THROUGH QUIET OR PUBLIC CONTACTS BETWEEN THE SIDES, BEFORE FINAL
AGREEMENT IS BROUGHT TO A ROUND TABLE AND SANCTIONED THERE.
THEN THERE SHOULD BE A NEW PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION ACCORDING
TO THE NEW PRINCIPLES AGREED UPON.  WHEN ASKED TO SPECIFY
REFORMS HE WANTED, HE MENTIONED PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION
IN PARLIAMENT WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF GETTING MORE YOUNG PEOPLE
IN.  HOWEVER, THIS SHOULD BE LIMITED TO NO MORE THAN THREE
PARTIES BEING ELECTED, AND LIST SHOULD PERMIT VOTERS TO EXPRESS
INDIVIDUAL PREFERENCES FOR PEOPLE ON THE LIST.  A SECOND CHAMBER
SHOULD BE CREATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS WELL-PUBLICIZED
PROGRAM.  OBJECTIVE IS TO ABOLISH CONFESSIONALISM AND
ELEIMINATE MEDIOCRITY IN PARLIAMENT.  I ASKED IF HE MEANT
ELIMINATING FEUDAL REMNANTS.  NO, JUMBLATT INSISTED, HE MEANT
ELIMINATING MEDIOCRITY. (COMMENT: JUMBLATT OF COURSE
DERIVES HIS MOST STEADY SUPPORT FROM HIS TRADITIONAL FEUDAL
SUZERAINTY OVER MUCH OF THE DRUZE COMMUNITY).
13.  PHALANGE (PROBABLY BASHIR GEMAYEL) HAS ACCEPTED
PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION, JUMBLATT ASSERTED, BUT NOT
AN END TO CONFESSIONALISM.  JUMBLATT THOUGH PARTIES OF THE
LEFT CAN IMPOSE ON OTHER, MORE CONSERVATIVE MUSLIMS A REFORM
PROGRAM WHICH WOULD, FOR EXAMPLE, PERMIT CIVIL MARRIAGE AND
SIMILAR CHANGES WHICH MANY CHRISTIANS SUPPORT.  YOUNG
PEOPLE, BOTH CHRISTIAN AND MUSLIM, ARE IDEALISTIC.  THEY WILL
INSIST ON TOUGH REFORMS.  THERE IS LITTLE DIFFERNENCE BETWEEN
THESE YOUNG PEOPLE, EXCEPT THAT THE CHRISTIAN YOUTH DO NOT
UNDERSTAND THE PALESTINIANS AND HOW TO HANDLE THEM.
MEANWHILE, COMPETITION AMONG TRADITIONAL CHRISTIAN LEADDERS
SUCH AS CHAMOUN AND GEMAYEL LENDS TO ESCALATION OF RHETORIC
AND MILITARY ACTION FOR NO GOOD REASON.  THIS SHOULD END.
14.  AS TO PALESTINIANS, ELIMINATION OF SAIQA HAS BEEN A GOOD
THING.  OF COURSE SOME GROUPS SUCH AS PFLP RESORT
INOPPORTUNELY TO TERRORISM (HERE JUMBLATT SHOWED HE DID
NOT APPROVE RECENT AIR FRANCE HIJACKING).  THERE ARE ALSO
TROUBLE-MAKING SMALL GROUPS BACKED BY LIBYANS AND IRAQIS
AS WELL AS SYRIANS.  HOWEVER, WITH SAIQA DISAPPEARANCE,
PALESTINIANS CAN NOW IMPOSE THEIR OWN LAW AMONG MOST OF
THEIR PEOPLE.  LEBANESE MUST LEARN HOW TO DEAL WITH
PALESTINIANS, OFFER THEM A BETTER LIFE.  THIS IS AN IMPORTANT
PEOPLE NUMBERING THREE MILLION THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.  THEY DO
NOT WANT TO LIVE HERE ONLY AS AN ARMY.  IN THIS SENSE, JUMBLATT
SAID HE HAD NO FEAR FOR THE FUTURE OF THE COUNTRY.  PEOPLE MAY
EVEN HAVE BENEFITED FROM THEIR EXORCISM OF BLOOD....
15.  SPECIFICALLY, JUMBLATT SAID, 1969 DAIRO ACCORD IS OUT OF
DATE,  BUT MODUS VIVENDI CAN BE REACHED WITH PALESTINIANS.  HE
NOTED THAT PALESTINIANS REMAIN IN TOUCH WITH CHRISTIANS THROUGH
ABU HASSAN WHO GOES BACK AND FORTH ACROSS THE DIVIDING LINE,
AS DOES PHALANGE'S BAYIR GEMAYEL.  HE THEN MADE SOME
REMARKS ABOUT A VIABLE PALESTINIAN STATE TO INCLUDE JORDAN,
AND THE 1,200,000 PALESTINIANS HAVING A COANCE TO RETURN TO
THEIR HOMES IN HAIFA, ETC. ETC. (JUMBLATT IS CLEARLY BEYOND
HIS DEPTH OR INTEREST WHEN HE STARTS TALKING ABOUT THE LARGER
PALESTINIAN PROBLEM).
16.  SPECIFICALLY ON SYRIANS, JUMBLATT SAID THAT THEY MUST LEAVE
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  ALL MUSLIMS ARE AGAINST THEM.  ASSAD IS
A MEDIOCRE MAN WHO HAS REPEATEDLY REFUSED TO TAKE
OPPORTUNITIES TO GET OUT OF THE LEBANON.  AS TO REASONS FOR
SYRIAN INTERVENTION, JUMBLATT SPECULATED, SOME SAY SYRIA
WANTS THE BEKAA.  OTHERS SAY SYRIA WISHES TO REPLACE FRANCE
AND HAS TAKEN THIS HISTORIC OPPORTUNITY TO GET CLOSE TO THE
MARONITES.  JUMBLATT CLAIMED ASSAD HAS SPECIFICALLY
TOLD HIM THIS ON FREQUENT OCCASIONS WHILE THEY WERE STILL IN
CONTACT, AS OF A FEW MONTHS AGO.  ALSO, ASSAD HOPED TO WIN
A CARD IN HIS DIPLOMATIC GAME, GOING TO FRANCE AS A FRIEND OF
JORDAN ON THE ONE HAND AND WITH CONTROL OVER LEBANON AND THE
PALESTINIANS ON THE OTHER.  THIS WOULD HAVE HELPED HIM IN US
EYES TOO AND MAYBE HELPED GET A GOLAN SETTLEMENT OF THE KIND
HE WANTS.  HOWEVER, EGYPT IS NOW BEGINNING TO REPLACE
SYRIA IN THE LEBANON AS IS NORMAL.  AT LEAST SADAT IN HIS
SINAI II POLICY WAS FRANK.  HE HAS WON MUCH RESPECT.
17.  JUMBLATT TENDED TO DOWN-PLAY THE PROBLEM OF SECURITY
IN LEBANON.  HE SAID THE VARIOUS PARTIES ARE BEGINNING TO TAKE
SECURITY IN HAND.  THERE ARE FEWER ASSASSINATIONS NOW AND LOOTING
IS LESS BOTH IN BEIRUT AND IN THE MOUNTAINS.  THE LEBANESE
ARMY WILL BE REBUILT.  THE POPULACE, ONCE IT HAS PEACE, WILL
SELL ITS ARMS.  WITH $20 MILLION, JUMBLATT SAID, THE STATE
COULD BUY BACK THE ARMS ITSELF.  PEOPLE ARE HUNGRY.  AGAIN
HE RETURNED TO HIS THEME THAT YOUNG PEOPLE MUST BE ALLOWED
TO TAKE POWER IN THIS COUNTRY.
18.  FINALLY, JUMBLATT WISHED ME WELL.  HE SAID DEAN BROWN
DID A GOOD JOB HERE.  HE PERHAPS LACKED PATIENCE.  IT IS
BETTER TOWORK A LITTLE MORE SLOWLY AND PATIENTLY AND PERHAPS
WITH LOWER PROFILE, BUT US CAN BE HELPFUL.
19.  SUMMING UP HIS VIEWS, JUMBLATT SAID HE EXPECTED THE
WAR TO END SOON.  EVEN THOUGH HE ADMITTED HIS OWN AIMS ARE
WHAT AMOUNT TO A CONTINUOUS REVOLUTION UNTIL POWER MOVES
FROM THE HANDS OF THE MARONITES TO HIS OWN AND THOSE OF
OTHERS ALLIED WITH HIM, HE THOUGHT MEDITERRANEAN PEOPLE
SUCH AS THE LEBANESE AND PALESTINIANS NEED A REST.  TIME
HAS COME FOR COMPROMISE, AND HE IS PREPARED FOR THAT.
WHEN I ASKED WHETHER CONCENTRATED BITTERNESS BETWEEN
FACTIONS MIGHT NOT IMPEDE COMPROMISE, HE SAID PEOPLE
TEND TO FORGET THE CARNAGE, BLOOD, AND DESTRUCTION,
PARTICULARLY IF A CATASTROPHE IS BIG ENOUGHT.  MEANWHILE
NOTHING CAN BE DONE BY WAY OF FORMAL PEACEMAKING UNTIL
THE SYRIANS WITHDRAW TOTALLY FROM THE LEBANON.
20.  COMMENT:  AS I HAVE BEEN TOLD TO EXPECT, JUMBLATT
HAS AN UNCANNILY WINNING PERSONALITY.  IT IS HARD TO DISLIKE THE
MAN FACE TO FACE.  HE HAS MANY MOODS AND MANY GUISES AND
SEEMS TO BE SPEAKING FRANKLY AT ALL TIMES.  HOWEVER, WHAT HE
SAID OFTEN STRUCK ME AS UNREALISTIC TO SAY THE LEAST.  IN
PARTICULAR, I WAS STRUCK BY HIS GREAT OPTIMISM TO ME IN VIEW
OF HIS SIMULTANEOUS PUBLIC PRONOUNCEMENTS THAT THE WAR WILL
CONTINUE AND VIETNAMIZATION MAY RESULT IF THE CHRISTIANS DO NOT
STOP THEIR ATTACK ON TELL XAATAR.  HE IS CLEARLY A MAN WHOSE
WORDS SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN AT FACE VALUE.  BUT HE IS ALSO A
LEADER WHO SEEMS INDISPENSIBLE IN THE CURRENT POLITICAL
MAKEUP HERE.  HE IS OUT TO BECOME NUMBER ONE IN THE LEBANON,
EVEN IF THIS TAKES A FEW MORE YEARS.

 * 309227 1976TELAV04653 0.007100336 | 1976-07-07 | TEL AVIV | STATE | MINDEF PERES' VIEWS ON LEBANON
1. DURING JULY 6 MEETING WITH AMBASSADOR TOON, MINISTER OF
DEFENSE PERES WAS ASKED TO GIVE HIS VIEWS ON THE LEBANESE
SITUATION. HE BEGAN BY STATING THAT KEY TO UNDERSTANDING
LEBANESE SITUATION IS ANSWER TO BASIC QUESTION - "WHAT IS
THE PURPOSE OF THE SYRIAN INTERVENTION?" PERES ADVANCED TWO
POSSIBLE ANSWERS. FIRST WAS HISTORIC SYRIAN DREAM OF A RE-
ESTABLISHED "GREATER SYRIA," BUT PERES FELT THAT THIS MOTIVE
WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER SERVED BY SYRIAN INTERVENTION ON THE
SIDE OF THE MUSLIMS. ACTUAL INTERVENTION ON SIDE OF CHRISTIANS
LEADS PERES TO FAVOR EXPLANATION THAT ASSAD FELT EXTREMELY
HARD PRESSED BETWEEN A HOSTILE IRAQI BA'ATH PARTY AND HOSTILE
JUMBLATT AND PLO FORCES IN LEBANON.
2. PERES SEES ASSAD AS RELUCTANT TO USE ENOUGH MILITARY
FORCE TO STABILIZE THE SITUATION. HE CLAIMED
THAT SYRIAN FORCES ARE NO LONGER INTERVENING BETWEEN
MUSLIM AND CHRISTIAN FORCES. ISRAEL FEELS THAT SYRIAN
FORCES ARE RETREATING TO BEKAA VALLEY WHERE THEY ARE
CONSOLIDATING THEIR HOLD. PERES SUGGESTED THAT ASSAD IS
REACTING TO, RATHER THAN STOPING, EVENTS IN LEBANON.
HE POINTED OUT THAT ORIGINALLY IT APPEARED THAT SYRIAN
MILITARY MOVES SUPPORTED ITS POLITICAL AIMS BUT THAT NOW
ASSAD SEEMS TO BE REVISING HIS POLITICAL AIMS AS THE
MILITARY SITUATION CHANGES.
3. PERES CLAIMS THAT IN LAST FEW DAYS, SYRIAN FORCES HAVE
REMOVED AGGM BOUNDARY MARKERS DELINEATING THE BORDER BETWEEN
SYRIAN AND THE BEKAA REGION OF LEBANON. HE SEES SYRIAN
ANNEXATION OF THE BEKAA AS A POSSIBILITY. THIS LED HIM TO
OPINE THAT, FROM ISRAEL'S POINT OF VIEW, A SYRIAN TAKE-OVER
OF LEBANON WOULD BE PREFERABLE TO A JUMBLATT,PLO TAKE-OVER.
HE STRESSED, HOWEVER, THAT THESE WERE NOT THE ONLY TWO
ALTERNATIVES. HE STILL SEES A UNITED AND INDEPENDENT
LEBANON AS POSSIBLE, PARTICULARLY IF THE SONS OF CHAMOUN
AND JEMIYAL CAN GET TOGETHER AND LEAD THE CHRISTIANS.
4. TURNING TO WHAT HE DESCRIBED AS RECENT SYRIAN HINTS THAT
FURTHER SYRIAN/ISRAELI NEGOTIATIONS MAY BE POSSIBLE,  PERES
FELT THAT ISRAEL SHOULD TAKE THEM SERIOUSLY. HIS MOOD
SEEMED TO BE QUITE UPBEAT.
5. FINALLY, PERES COVERED A POTPOURRI OF MILITARY RELATED
TOPICS.HE ASSERTED THAT EGYPT IS SUPPLYING LARGE QUANTITIES
OF ARMS AND AMMUNITION TO THE PLO IN LEBANON. HE FEELS
THIS POLICY IS MISTAKEN AND SHORT-SIGHTED BUT SEES IT AS
INSPIRED BY EGYPTIAN HATRED OF SYRIA. PERES CLAIMS THAT
IDF NAVY, IN ANSWER TO A DISTRESS CALL, TOWED A DISABLED
GREEK FREIGHTER INTO HAIFA HARBOR FOR REPAIRS. CARGO WAS
SHIPMENT OF ARMS CONSIGNED TO PLO IN TYRE. ACCORDING TO
CREW, AN EGYPTIAN GENERAL SUPERVISED ONLOAD IN ALEXANDRIA.
6. CHRISTIAN FORCES IN LEBANON ARE FACING SHORTAGES OF ARMS
AND AMMO, ACCORDING TO PERES, WHILE MUSLIMS ARE IN GOOD
SHAPE. HE CLAIMED THAT MUSLIMS HAVE AN UNLIMITED SUPPLY OF
MEDIUM RANGE ANTI-TANK PRG'S, FOR EXAMPLE.
7. FINALLY, PERES PROVIDED SOME INFORMATION ON EARLY SYRIAN
FIGHTING WHICH WAS NEW TO US. HE CLAIMED THAT VANGUARD
OF SYRIAN FORCES GIVEN HEROES' WLCOME IN SIDON AND TRIPOLI
AND WERE THEN AMBUSHED, TAKING HEAVY CASUALTIES. HE ALSO
CLAIMED THAT IN EARLY DAYS OF SYRIAN INTERVENTION, THERE
WERE CLASHES BETWEEN SYRIAN AND IRAQI FORCES IN THE TRIPOLI
AREA, RESULTING IN THE WITHDRAWAL OF SYRIAN FORCES FROM THE
VICINITY OF TRIPOLI.

 * 252131 1976STATE166465 0.007099963 | 1976-07-03 | STATE | SECRETARY | SADAT'S STATEMENTS RE PEACE TERMS
1. IN CASE YOU MISSED IT, SADAT GAVE CHARLES DEVINE OF
READER'S DIGEST, JUNE 30, FOLLOWING COMMENTS ON HIS VIEWS
RE ME PEACE SETTLEMENT TAKEN FROM FBIS AND CHECKED AGAINST
TODAY'S AL-AKHBAR STORY ON THAT INTERVIEW.
2. REPLYING TO A QUESTION BY MR. DEVINE ON WHETHER A
CHANGE IN U.S. ADMINISTRATION AFTER THE ELECTIONS MIGHT
AFFECT THE ABILITY OF THE UNITED STATES TO PARTICIPATE
IN SOLVING THE MIDDLE EAST PROBLEM, PRESIDENT AS-SADAT
SAID: I BELIEVE, A CHANGE IN ADMINISTRATION MIGHT DELAY
A SOLUTION FOR SOME TIME, BUT IT WILL NOT LEAD TO COMPLICA-
TIONS IN THE U.S. ATTITUDE TOWARD THE MIDDLE EAST QUESTION.
NATURALLY, THE UNITED STATES HAS THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE THE
PRESIDENT IT THINKS MOST SUITABLE FOR IT. WHAT I HAVE
READ ABOUT CARTER SHOWS THAT HE SUPPORTS A PEACEFUL
SOLUTION.
3. I AM SURE THAT AFTER HAVING MET WITH MANY OF THE
POLITICIANS IN THE UNITED STATES AND SEEN THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE--AND I TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO ONCE AGAIN THANK
THEM FOR THE WARM HOSPITALITY ACCORDED US DURING OUR LAST
VISIT AND FOR THEIR REAL SENTIMENTS WHICH HAVE GREATLY
MOVED US--THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT A PEACEFUL
SOLUTION. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ALSO WANTS A PEACEFUL
SOLUTION.
4. IF THERE IS A CHANGE IN ADMINISTRATION AFTER THE
ELECTIONS, THIS WOULD DELAY THE PEACEFUL SOLUTION FOR
SOME TIME AS HAPPENED IN 1974. THE SECOND DISENGAGEMENT
AGREEMENT WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN CONCLUDED IN 1974
AND NOT, AS HAPPENED, IN 1975. BUT IN VIEW OF THE
WATERGATE ISSUE, THE SECOND DISENGAGEMENT AGREEMENT WAS
ELAYED FOR ONE YEAR. I BELIEVE A NEW ADMINISTRATION, IF
THERE SHOULD BE ONE, WILL NEED SOME TIME TO STUDY AND
ABSORB THE WHOLE SITUATION. AFTER THAT, AS I SAID, AND
WHETHER THE NEW PRESIDENT IS DEMOCRATIC OR REPUBLICAN,
THE UNITED STATES WILL HOLD 99 PERCENT OF THE CARDS IN
THE MIDDLE EAST GAME.
5. MR. DEVINE ASKED PRESIDENT AS-SADAT THIS QUESTION:
MR. PRESIDENT, YOU SAID IN FEBRUARY 1974 THAT YOU WOULD
NOT RUN AGAIN FOR THE POST OF PRESIDENT IN EGYPT. WHAT
MADE YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND ABOUT THAT?
6. REPLYING TO A QUESTION ON THE SOLUTION HE WILL OFFER
TO THE MIDDLE EAST PROBLEM CONCERNING GAZA, SHARM ASH-
SHAYKH, THE PALESTINIANS, THE GOLAN HEIGHTS, SINAI, THE
WEST BANK AND THE GULF OF AQABA, PRESIDENT AS-SADAT SAID:
FIRST, WE MUST AGREE ON THE BASIC FACT THAT THE ISRAELIS
MUST WITHDRAW FROM ALL THE TERRITORIES TO THE 1967 BORDERS,
INCLUDING JERUSALEM. WE WILL THEN CONSIDER SINAI.
7. THE PRESIDENT SAID: I WILL AGREE TO THE STATIONING OF
UN FORCES IN SHARM ASH-SHAYKH AFTER THE ISRAELI WITHDRAWL
FROM THERE. THE UN FORCES CAN STAY THERE TO GUARANTEE
THE FREEDOM OF SHIPPING. REGARDING THE OTHER INTER-
NATIONAL GUARANTEES, I AM WILLING TO ACCEPT THE PRESENCE
OF A UN FORCE IN SHARM ASH-SHAYKH. REGARDING OUR BORDER,
I AM ALSO WILLING TO AGREE TO THE PRESENCE OF UN FORCES
THERE ALSO, PROVIDED THAT THEY ARE STATIONED ON BOTH SIDES.
BUT I WILL BE UNDERSTANDING AND CONSIDERATE CONCERNING
THE PROPORTION OF THE AREA TO BE GIVEN FOR THE STATIONING
OF THESE FORCES. IF ISRAEL SHOWS A WILLINGNESS TO SOLVE
THE PALESTINE QUESTION COMPLETELY, ITS SHIPS CAN PASS
THROUGH THE SUEZ CANAL. WE ARE READY FOR THAT IF THEY
AREA ALSO READY FOR IT.;
8. REGARDING THE PALESTINIANS, I REQUEST THE SETTING UP
OF A PALESTINIAN STATE IN THE WEST BANK AND GAZA WITH A
CORRIDOR BETWEEN THEM.
9. REGARDING THE GOLAN, THE SYRIANS CAN SPEAK FOR THEM-
SELVES. ONCE WE HAVE REACHED THIS STAGE, I DO NOT THINK
THAT PRESIDENT AL-ASAD, FOR INSTANCE, WILL OBJECT TO THE
STATIONING OF OBSERVERS ON THE BORDER. BUT THIS IS SOME-
THING ON WHICH I CANNOT DECIDE. IT IS UP TO PRESIDENT
AL-ASAD AND SYRIA.
10. THE GREAT CONCESSION WHICH WE WILL MAKE ONCE THE
COMPLETE ISRAELI WITHDRAWAL FROM ALL THE OCCUPIED ARAB
TERRITORIES TO THE 1967 BORDERS IS ACHIEVED, THE
PALESTINE PROBLEM IS SOLVED AND A PALESTINIAN STATE
ESTABLISHED, IS THAT WE WILL END THE STATE OF WAR,WHICH
HAS EXISTED FOR THE PAST 28 YEARS. WE WILL THEN TRY TO
BUILD LASTING PEACE IN THE WHOLE REGION.
11. COMMENT: YOU WILL NOTE THAT SADAT ACKNOWLEDGES THAT
A POSSIBLE CHANGE IN ADMINISTRATION MIGHT DELAY SOLUTION
FOR A TIME PENDING STIDY OF THE PROBLEM BY A NEW ADMINISTRA-
TION. BY PUBLICLY INDICATING THIS, AND HAVING IT
PUBLISHED IN CAIRO'S DAILY, AKHBAR, HE IS GIVING HIMSELF
SOME BREATHING SPACE IF THINGS DO NOT WORK OUT THE WAY
HE WOULD LIKE, I. E., RE-ELECTION OF PRESIDENT FORD.
SADAT'S SUBSTANTIVE VIEWS ARE NOT NEW. NOR ARE HIS
STATED CONDITIONS FOR ENDING THE STATE OF WAR, E.G.,
ISRAELI WITHDRAWAL AND ESTABLISHMENT OF A PALESTINIAN
STATE. HE IS TAKING A LEAF OUT OF THE ISRAELI BOOK BY
THUS PUBLICLY STATING HIS WILINGNESS TO END THE STATE
OF WAR, BUT STIPULATING HIS PRICE FOR DOING SO AND MAKING IT
CONSISTENT WITH ARAB ASPIRATIONS. IN PART, OF COURSE, THIS IS FOR
GENERAL ARAB CONSUMPTION. HOWEVER, HE IS ALSO SIGNALLING US AND
THE ISRAELIS ONCE AGAIN THE
THE EXISTING ISRAELI OFFER IS
INADEQUATE. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I KNOW OF THAT HE
HAS PUBLICLY SUGGESTED UN CONTROLLED DMZ ON THE BORDERS
MIGHT BE PROPORTIONAL RATHER THAN IDENTICAL IN SIZE,
THOUGH HE MADE THIS STATEMENT TO CODEL OBEY LAST AUGUST.
EARLIER IN THE INTERVIEW SADAT REAFFIRMED HIS BELIEF GENEVA IS BEST
FORUM TO BEGIN INITIAL TALKS AND THAT PLO SHOULD BE REPRESENTED.

 * 328280 1976VALLET00794 0.007099315 | 1976-07-07 | VALLETTA | STATE | MALTA - QUARTERLY POLITICAL/ECONOMIC REPORT
1.  SUMMARY. THE LONG AWAITED MALTESE PARLIAMENTARY
ELECTION IS ALMOST AT HAND. IF PRIME MINISTER MINTOFF
DOES NOT DECIDE ON AN EARLIER ELECTION DATE, PARLIAMENT
WILL BE DISSOLVED AUTOMATICALLY IN MID-AUGUST, AND THE
ELECTION MUST FOLLOW NOT LATER THAN MID-NOVEMBER. WITH
ACTIVE CAMPAIGNING ALREADY WELL UNDERWAY, THIS QUARTERLY
REPORT CONCENTRATES ON MALTESE FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC
POLICIES WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO BE MAJOR ISSUES IN THE
FORTHCOMING ELECTION. OFFICIAL US/MALTESE BILATERAL
RELATIONS REMAINED QUIET AND GENERALLY HARMONIOUS DURING
THIS QUARTER. END SUMMARY
2.  MALTESE FOREIGN POLICY ISSUES. DURING THE PAST FIVE
YEARS, PRIME MINISTER MINTOFF'S LABOR GOVERNMENT HAS
TURNED FROM MALTA'S FORMER CLOSE TIES WITH THE UNITED
KINGDOM, WESTERN EUROPE AND NATO TOWARD A POLICY OF NON-
ALIGNMENT AND IDENTIFICATION WITH THE THIRD WORLD. MALTA
HAS BECOME AN OFFICIAL MEMBER OF THE NON-ALIGNED MOVEMENT
AND THE GROUP OF 77. AS A RESULT, MALTA'S INTERNATIONAL
POSTURE, AND ITS VOTING RECORD AT MULTILATERAL MEETINGS,
HAS CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY FROM ITS PRO-WESTERN IDENTIFICATION
OF THE 1960'S.
FORTHERMORE, MINTOFF HAS LED MALTA INTO A SHARPLY
PRO-ARAB, ANTI-ISRAELI STANCE IN MIDDLE EASTERN AFFAIRS.
THE PRIME MINISTER HAS CULTIVATED AN EXTREMELY CLOSE
PERSONAL ASSOCIATION WITH COLONEL QADHAFI, AND ADVOCATED
"BROTHERLY" TIES BETWEEN THE LIBYAN AND MALTESE PEOPLES
AS BEING IN MALTA'S BEST INTERESTS. QADHAFI HAS STATED
PUBLICLY THAT IF MALTA WILL ELIMINATE ITS RELATIONS WITH
NATO AND THE WEST, THEN LIBYA WILL THEREAFTER HELP TO
ASSURE MALTA'S POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC FUTURE.
MINTOFF HAS TAKEN A FIRM POSITION AGAINST THE PRESENCE
OF BOTH THE AMERICAN AND SOVIET FLEETS IN THE MEDITERRANEAN,
AND HE FOUGHT STRONGLY AT CSCE FOR THEIR REMOVAL FROM THE
AREA. HE HAS DENIED ACCESS BY EITHER FLEET TO MALTA AND
ADVOCATES TURNING THE MEDITERRANEAN INTO A "SEA OF PEACE"
WITHOUT SUPPER POWER INVOLVEMENT. TO CAP HIS ANTI-AMERICAN/
ANTI-SOVIET POSTURE, MINTOFF HAS INTRODUCED A SIGNIFICANT
CHINESE TEHCNICAL ASSISTANCE PRESENCE IN MALTA AND IN
EXCHANGE, STRONGLY SUPPORTED CHINESE POLICIES IN SOUTHEAST
ASIA AND KOREA.
PERHAPS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FOREIGN POLICY CHANGE
WHICH MINTOFF HAS BROUGHT TO MALTA HAS BEEN HIS INSISTENCE
THAT THE ISLAND MUST LOSE ITS HISTORICAL "FORTRESS IMAGE",
AND THAT ALL "FOREIGN" (I.E. BRITISH) MILITARY FORCES
MUST LEAVE PERMANENTLY. AS A RESULT OF MINTOFF'S DEMANDS,
THE MALTESE"U.K. MILITARY FACILITIES AGREEMENT PROVIDES
THAT ALL BRITISH FORECES WILL HAVE LEFT MALTA BY MARCH 31,
1979. WHEN THAT HAPPENS, MORE THAN 150 YEARS OF MODERN
MALTESE TRADITION WILL HAVE COME TO AN END, WITH ALL OF
THE POLITICAL AND SECURITY QUESTIONS WHICH THAT WILL
INVOLVE.
THESE MINTOFFIAN IDEAS HAVE BEEN VERY CONTROVERSIAL
IN MALTA. AS A RESULT, THE ENTIRE SPECTRUM OF LABOR
FOREIGN POLICY WHICH HAS EVOLVED SINCE 1971 WILL CERTAINLY
BE A MAJOR ISSUE IN THE FORTHCOMING PARLIAMENTARYELECTION.
PERHAPS TO OVERSIMPLIFY, THE BASIC QUESTION WHICH THE
MALTESE ELECTORATE MUST DECIDE IS WHETHER THEY WISH TO
CONTINUE MOVING IN THE "NEUTRALIST", THIRD WORLD DIIRECTION
WHICH MINTOFF AND THE LABORITES HAVE CHARTED; OR WHETHER
THEY PREFER TO TURN BACK TOWARD A MORE EUROPEAN-ORIENTED
POSUTRE, AS REPRESENTED BY THE OPPOSITION NATIONALISTS.
LOOMING IN THE BACKGROUND OF THIS ISSUE IS MINTOFF'S
HEAVY-HANDED COURTING OF QADHAFI. MANY MALTESE, EVEN
LABORITES, ARE HIGHLY SUSPICIOUS OF QADHAFI'S RELIABILITY
AND HIS INTENTIONS TOWARD MALTA. THEY WOULD NOT WANT TO
SEE THE BRITISH MILITARY PRESENCE HERE REPLACED BY LIBYAN
CONTROL IN THE 1980'S.
BOTH MALTESE POLITICAL PARTIES CLAIM THEY WOULD PREFER
A TRULY INDEPENDENT STANCE FOR MALTA, WITH THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN THEM ARISING FROM HOW BEST TO ACHIEVE THIS. DURING
HIS TERM OF OFFICE, MINTOFF HAS BEEN ABLE TO SEEK CLOSER
IDENTIFICATION WITH THE RADICAL POLICIES OF THE THIRD
WORLD WITHOUT TOO MUCH CONCERN, BECAUSE THE BRITISH PRESENCE
HAS ASURED THE MALTESE OF SECURITY AND STABILITY WHILE HE
WAS DOING SO.

ALTHOUGH THE BRITISH PRESENCE WILL CONTINUE FOR SEVERAL
MORE YEARS BEYOND THE FORTHCOMING ELECTION, MALTA'S FUTURE
AFTER 1979 CANNOT HELP BUT BE A MAJOR QUESTION IN THE
VOTER'S MINDS DURING THE CAMPAIGN.
3.  MALTESE DOMESTIC POLICY ISSUES. THERE ARE MANY CROSS-
CURRENTS OF DOMESTIC POLICY WHICH WILL HAVE AN EFFECT ON
THE FORTHCOMING MALTESE ELECTION. MINTOFF'S LABOR
GOVERNMENT DOUBTLESS WILL CAMPAIGN LARGELY ON ITS RECORD
OF THE PAST FIVE YEARS, WITH CLAIMS OF GREAT SUCCESS IN
EVERY FIELD, WHILE CONTRASTING THIS WITH WHAT IT DESCRIBES
AS "NINE YEARS OF CORRUPTION AND FAILURE" UNDER THE
PREVIOUS NATIONALIST ADMINISTRATION.
THE LABOR RECORD IS IMPRESSIVE IN MANY AREAS. THEY
HAVE CONTROLLED INFLATION REASONABLY WELL, AND ESTABLISHED
SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED SALARIES, HIGHER MINIMUM WAGES,
AND IMPROVED WORKING CONDITIONS FOR MOST MALTESE WORKERS.
THEY HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED SOCIAL BENEFITS FOR
ALMOST ALL MALTESE, INTRODUCING CHILDREN'S ALLOWANCES,
"CHRISTMAS/ BONUSES (A VERSION OF THIRTEEN-MONTH WAGE
PAYMENTS) AND BETTER HEALTH AND RETIREMENT BENEFITS.
THEY HAVE PLACED CONSIDERABLE EMPHASIS ON A PUBLIC HOUSING
PROGRAM. HOWEVER, ALL OF THESE ACTIVITIES HAVE BEEN AT
THE EXPENSE OF HIGHER TAXES, REDUCED PROFITS FOR THE
PRIVATE SECTOR, AND DECLINING CONFIDENCE AMONG BUSINESSMEN
AND INDUSTRIALISTS.
MOREOVER, THE LABOR GOVERNMENT HAS SUFFERED ONE MAJOR
FAILURE IN THE DOMESTIC AREA. LIKE EARLIER NATIONALIST
GOVERNMENTS, THE LABORITES HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY UNABLE TO
FIND THE ANSWER TO MALTA'S HISTORIC AND ENDEMIC PROBLEM
OF THE LACK OF SUFFICIENT PRODUCTIVE JOBS FOR ITS PUPULATION.
THE PREVIOUS NATIONALIST ADMINISTRATION EMPHASIZED
PRIVATE (INCLUDING FOREIGN) INVESTMENT AND EMIGRATION AS
THE BEST ANSWERS TO DOMESTIC UNEMPLOYMENT. IN TRADITIONAL
SOCIALIST FASHION, MINTOFF'S LABOR GOVERNMENT HAS TURNED
ITS BACK ON "CAPITALIST" SOLUTIONS, IN THE PROCESS DOING
AWAY WITH SEVERAL INVESTMENT INCENTIVE PROGRAMS ESTABLISHED
BY THE NATIONALIST GOVERNMENT, AND EXPANDED STATE-OWNED
AND PARASTATAL ACTIVITIES INSTEAD.
ALONG WITH THIS, MINTOFF HAS CONDUCTED A VERY HEAVY-
HANDED GOVERNMENT TAKEOVER CAPAIGN IN KEY BUSINESS AND
INDUSTRIAL SECTORS, INCLUDING TLECOMMUNICATIONS, RADIO
AND TELEVISION BROADCASTING, BANKING, AND AIR AND SEA
TRANSPORATION. HE HAS, IN THE PROCESS BADLY UNDERMINED
THE LOCAL INVESTMENT CLIMATE. MINTOFF HAS ALSO BEEN
FORCED TO RESCUE A NUMBER OF UNPROFITABLE PRIVATE FIRMS
FROM BANKRUPTCY THROUGH STATE INTERVENTION, WHEN INTER-
NATIONAL RECESSION AND THE LACK OF DOMESTIC CONFIDENCE
ADVERSELY AFFECTED THE MALTESE ECONOMY.
MINTOFF'S MAJOR SOLUTION TO DOMESTIC EMPLOYMENT, AND
DOUBTLESS ONE OF HIS MOST CONTROVIERSIAL ECONOMIC POLICIES,
HAS BEEN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A NUMBER OF GOVERNMENT-
FINANCED AND CONTROLLED "MAKE-WORK" JOB CORPS. THIS HAS
RESULTED IN THOUSANDS OF MEN AND WOMEN BEING PUT ON THE
RATHER GENEROUS PUBLIC DOLE AND ASSIGNED TO VARIOUS
RELATIVELY INEFFICIENT AND OFTEN NON-PRODUCTIVE WORK
PROJECTS. THE PARA-MILITARY NATURE OF THESE JOB CORPS
HAS RAISED MANY QUESTIONS, DUE TO THE FACT THAT THEIR
MEMBERS ARE DENIED BASIC WORKERS' RIGHTS. DESPITE THESE
CORPS, UNEMPLOYMENT ALSO CONTINUES AT A HIGH
LEVEL FOR THIS SMALL COUNTRY. MINTOFF HAS JUST NOT BEEN
ABLE TO EXPAND MALTA'S INDUSTRIAL BASE SUFFICIENTLY TO
ABSORB ITS EXPANDING WORK FORCE.
HOVERING OVER THE BASIC DOMESTIC PROBLEM OF
UNEMPLOYMENT, IS THE FORTHCOMING WITHDRAWAL OF THE BRITISH
MILITARY FORCES DURING 1977-1979. NOT ONLY WILL THIS
RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF
GAINFULLY-EMPLOYED MALTESE OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS,
BUT WITH THE EXPIRATION OF THE MILITARY FACILITIES AGREE-
MENT, MALTA ALSO WILL LOSE SOME $80 MILLION ANNUALLY
IN DIRECT AND INDIRECT INCOME FROM NATO-FINANCED "BASE-
RENTAL" PAYMENTS AND LOCAL BRITISH EXPENDITURES. THERE
IS NO ALTERNATIVE SOURCE OF INCOME IN VIEW TO REPLACE THIS
CRUCIAL SUPPORT TO THE MALTESE ECONOMY. WITHOUT IT, THE
PRESENT MALTESE STANDARD OF LIVING WOULD NOT BE SUPPORTABLE.
NEITHER MALTESE POLITICAL PARTY HAS A FIRM ANSWER TO
THIS VERY BASIC ISSUE. IT IS PROBABLY THAT BOTH WOULD
LIKE TO CONTINUE TO "SELL" MALTA TO ONE OR ANOTHER BIDDER
IN ORDER TO KEEP THE ECONOMY INTACT, BUT WITHOUT OFFERING
THE ACTUAL USE OF MILITARY FACILITIES OR PERHHAPS HOPE THAT
NATO, IN SOME FASHION, WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORTMALTA
FINANCIALLY. MINTOFF HAS VAGUER IDEAS, INVOLVING SOME
COMBINATION OF EUROPEAN AND ARABIC MEDITERRANEAN COUNTRIES,
INCLUDING HIS FIREND QADHAFI, AS THE GUARANTORS OF MALTA'S
NEUTRALITY.
THIS MUCH IS CLEAR. ECONOMIC SURVIVAL IN THE 1980'S
AND THE ATTENDANT POLITICAL AND SECURITY QUESTIONS WHICH
THIS INVOLVES, WILL BE A MAJOR ELECTORAL ISSUE. THE
MALTESE ARE ACCUSTOMED TO BEING SUPPORTED BY SUBSTANTIAL
SUBSIDIES FROM ABROAD, AND IT WILL BE DIFFICULT FOR
EITHER THE LABORITES OR THE NATIONALISTS TO PRESENT THE
ELECTORATE WITH A CONVINCING ANSWER TO THIS FUTURE PROBLEM.

4.  THE ELECTION:  PARTIES, PERSONALITIES AND PROCEDURES.
THE PRESENT MALTESE PARLIAMENT WILL COMPLETE ITS FIVE-YEAR
TERM ON AUGUST 15 UNLESS PRIME MINISTER MINTOFF DECIDES ON
AN EARLIER DISSOLUTION. UNDER THE CONSTITUTION, THE GENERAL
ELECTION MUST FOLLOW NOT LATER THAN THREE MONTHS AFTER
DISSOLUTION. THE ELECTION COULD, THEREFORE, OCCUR AT ANY
TIME THIS SUMER OR FALL, UP UNTIL THE WEEKEND OF NOVEMBER
12-13.
BOTH POLITICAL PARTIES HAVE LONG SINCE BEEN CAMPAIGNING
IN EARNEST. THE ONLY REMAINING STEPS TO BE TAKEN BY THE
PARTIES ARE THE OFFICIAL RELEASE OF THEIR LISTS OF
CANDIDATES, AND THE PUBLICATION OF THEIR ELECTORAL PROGRAMS.
THESE PARTY MANIFESTOES TEND TO BE WIDE-RANGING AND COVER
A LARGE NUMBER OF ISSUES, MANY OF WHICH ARE ONLESOF LIMITED
SIGNIFICANCE TO THE ELECTION. THE FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC
POLICY PROBLEMS CITED ABOVE WILL CERTAINLY RECEIVE MAJOR
ATTENTION BY BOTH PARTIES IN THEIR MANIFESTOES.
DESPITE THE VERY REAL ISSUES WITH WHICH THE MALTESE
ELECTORATE MUST GRAPPLE, THE OUTCOME WILL REST TO A
SIGNIFICENT EXTENT ON THE PERSONALITIES OF THE TWO PARTY
LEADERS AND THEIR SUPPORTING CANDIATES.
THE LABOR PARTY IS IDENTIFIED ALMOST TOTALLY WITH
THE ECCENTRIC AND FLAMBOYANT DOM MINTOFF, AND THE
EXTENSIVE PERSONALITY CULT WHICH HAS GROWN UP AROUND
HIM AS PARTY AND PARLIAMENTARY LEADER OVER THE YEARS.
THE NATIONALIST PARTY, ON THE OTHER HAND, IS MORE
NEARLY A COLLECTION OF INDIVIDUALISTS WITHOUT A STRONG
SENSE OF PURPOSE, OTHER THAN SOMEWHAT VAGUE COMMITMENTS
TO FREE ENTERPRISE AND THE RESTORATION OF MALTA'S
TRADITIONAL WESTERN TIES. THE WEAK, INEFFECTUAL OPPOSITION
LEADER, GIORGIO BORG OLIVIER, IS NO MATCH FOR MNTOFF IN
THE PERSONALITY SWEEPSTAKES.
HOWEVER, MALTA'S ELECTORAL SYSTEM IS A VERY COMPLICATED
ONE, WITH A TRANSFERABLE VOTE PROCEDURE THAT PLACES MORE
EMPHASIS ON THE RELATIVE APPEAL OF SECONDARY CANDIDATES
THAN THAT OF THE PARTY LEADERS. THERE ARE THIRTEEN
ELECTORAL DISTRICTS AND SISTY-FIVE PARLIAMENTARY SEATS
AT STAKE. WITH AN ALMOST ENDLESS LIST OF CANDIDATES AND
ONLY 218,000 ELIGIBLE VOTERS, LITERALLY EVERY VOTE WILL
COUNT (AND MORE THAN ONCE UNDER THE MALTESE PREFERENCE
SYSTEM).
IN THE 1971 ELECTION, CANDIDATES WERE ELECTED WITH
AS FEW AS 500 DIRECT VOTES ON THE FIRST "COUNT", AND THE
FINAL OVER-ALL RESULT WAS EXTREMELY CLOSE, WITH THE LABOR
PARTY WINNING ONLY A ONE-SEAT PARLIAMENTARY MAJORITY AND
4,600 VOTES MORE THAN THE NATIONALISTS.
THIS YEAR, THE VOTING IS AGAIN EXPECTED TO BE CLOSE.
THE GENERAL CONSENSUS HAS BEEN THAT MINTOFF AND THE
LABORITIES HAVE ENJOYED A LIMITED, BUT DECIDED ADVANTAGE
OVER THE NATIONALISTS. HOWEVER, THERE IS NOW SOME FEELING
THAT THERE MAY BE A SWING AMONG THE "UNDECIDED" AND
"FLOATING" VOTERS BACK TOWARD THE NATIONALISTS. IN 1971,
THE "TIME FOR A CHANGE" ATTITUDE AMONG THIS GROUP OF
VOTERS WORKED IN MINTOFF'S FAVOR. IN 1976, THERE COULD
BE A REVERSAL OF THIS EFFECT.
IN ANY EVENT, THERE ARE MANY UNKNOWNS. THERE ARE NO
BY-ELECTIONS OR PUBLIC OPINION POLLS IN MALTA, AND 40,000
VOTERS HAVE NEVER PARTICIPATED IN AN ELECTION BEFORE
(THE MINIMUM VOTING AGE RECENTLY WAS LOWERED FROM 21 TO
18). SO DESPITE THE FACT THAT PARTY LEADERS ON BOTH SIDES
CLAIM THEY ARE CONFIDENT OF VICTORY, NO ONE CAN REALLY BE
CERTAIN OF THE OUTCOME. BUT AFTER FIVE YEARS WITHOUT AN
OPPORTUNITY TO EXPRESS THEIR APPROVAL OR DISAPPROVAL OF
MINTOFF'S VARIOUS ACTS OF SHOWMANSHIP, THE MALTESE POEPLE
ARE AT LEAST READY TO HAVE THEIR SAY.
5.  BILATERAL RELATIONS. PRIME MINISTER MINTOFF IS STILL
PRESSING HARD THROUGH EVERY POSSIBLE CHANNEL FOR A MEETING
WITH SECRETARY KISSINGER PRIOR TO THE MALTESE ELECTIONS.
EVEN THOUGH HE IS PROBABLY AWARE OF THE UNLIKELIHOOD OF
SUCH A MEETING BEFORE THE ELECTION, MINTOFF REFUSES TO
TAKE "NO" FOR AN ANSWER. BECAUSE OF MINTOFF'S CLEAR
DESIRE TO UTLIZIE THE PROPOSED MEETING TO GAIN A CAMPAIGN
ADVANTAGE OVER THE OPPOSITION NATIONALIST PARTY, THIS
WILL REMAIN AN IRRITANT TO OUR BILATERAL RELATIONS AT
LEAST UNTIL THE ELECTION IS OVER.
EXCEPT FOR THIS IRRITANT, HOWEVER, OFFICIAL U.S./
MALTESE RELATIONS WERE QUIET AND GENRALLY HARMONIOUS
DURING THIS QUARTER, AND THE EMBASSY CONTINED TO HAVE
EXCELLENT ACCESS TO SENIOR OFFICIALS OF THE GOM.
THE NEW U.S. PEACE CORPS VETERINARIAN ARRIVED IN
MALTA DURING THE QUARTER AND IS NOW ENGAGED IN PROJECTS
RECOMMENDED BY THE GOM MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE AND
FISHERIES.
THE GOM WAS ABLE TO UTILIZE ALMOST THE ENTIRE FIVE
MILLION DOLLAR USG SUPPORTING ASSISTANCE LOAN BEFORE THE
LOAN TERMINATION DATE OF JUNE 15, 1976. THE UNDISBURSED
AMOUNT WAS REPORTED BY AID/W TO BE ONLY SOME DOLLARS
20,720 AS OF JUNE 30.
WITH THE TERMINATION OF THE SUPPORTING ASSISTANCE
LOAN, THE PEACE CORPS VETERINARIAN PROJECT IS THE ONLY
REMIANING BILATERAL U.S. PROGRAM IN MALTA. SMITH

1.  DISCUSSED SUBJECT REFTEL WITH ST. LEGIER, FOREIGN
MINISTRY DIRECTOR FOR UNITED NATIONS AFFAIRS.
2.  ST. LEGIER SAID IT WAS HIS UNDERSTANDING THAT AMIN
HAD FILED COMPLAINT WITH SECURITY COUNCIL, BUT HAD NOT
REQUESTED A MEETING.  GOF HOPES THIS IS TRUE.
2.  IN THE EVENT AN SC MEETING TAKES PLACE, ST. LEGIER
SAID GOF AGREES THAT ANY RESOLUTION MUST NOT BE UNBAL-
ANCED.  UGANDA MUST BE CRITICIZED FOR AIDING THE TERROR-
ISTS.  THE QUESTION OF ISRAEL'S ACTION IS CAUSING GOF
JURIDICAL PROBLEMS.  WHEREAS UGANDA'S AID TO TERRORISTS
IS CLEARLY IN VIOLATION OF INTERNATIONAL CONVENTIONS,
SPECIFICALLY THE 1972 ANTI-HIJACKING TREATY, IT IS DIF-
FICULT TO FIND A PRECEDENT IN INTERNATIONAL LAW TO JUS-
TIFY ISRAEL'S VIOLATION OF UGANDA'S SOVEREIGNTY.  GOF
LAWYERS ARE WORKING ON THIS ASPECT.
3.  BECAUSE OF THE UNCLEAR JURIDICAL ASPECTS, ST. LEGIER
SAID THE BEST COURSE MIGHT BE TO CALL FOR AN OFFICIAL
ENQUIRY IN ORDER TO BURY THE ISSUE.  ON THE BASIC ISSUES,
HOWEVER, THE GOF IS ON OUR SIDE--OPPOSITION TO AN UNBAL-
ANCED RESOLUTION, AND LANGUAGE IN THE RESOLUTION MUST
INCLUDE CRITICISM OF UGANDA'S ASSISTANCE TO THE TERROR-
ISTS.
4.  COMMENT:  ST. LEGIER'S REMARKS REVEAL GOF DILEMMA.
ISRAELI ACTION WAS TREMENDOUSLY POPULAR IN FRANCE.
FRENCH PRESS WAS ECSTATIC IN ITS PRAISE.  ON THE OTHER
HAND, FRANCE WANTS TO GET THE AIR BUS BACK FROM ENTEBBE
AIRPORT, AND DOES NOT WANT TO BE OPPOSED TO AFRICAN
OPINION RIGHT AFTER RECEIVING CRITICISM OF THE NUCLEAR
REACTOR SALE TO SOUTH AFRICA.  HENCE, A DESIRE FOR NO
MEETING, AND FOR NO RESOLUTION IF THERE IS A MEETING.

 * 49500 1976CAIRO09079 0.007098599 | 1976-07-03 | CAIRO | STATE | SADAT'S STATEMENTS RE PEACE TERMS
1. IN CASE YOU MISSED IT, SADAT GAVE CHARLES DEVINE OF
READER'S DIGEST, JUNE 30, FOLLOWING COMMENTS ON HIS VIEWS
RE ME PEACE SETTLEMENT TAKEN FROM FBIS AND CHECKED AGAINST
TODAY'S AL-AKHBAR STORY ON THAT INTERVIEW.
2. REPLYING TO A QUESTION BY MR. DEVINE ON WHETHER A
CHANGE IN U.S. ADMINISTRATION AFTER THE ELECTIONS MIGHT
AFFECT THE ABILITY OF THE UNITED STATES TO PARTICIPATE
IN SOLVING THE MIDDLE EAST PROBLEM, PRESIDENT AS-SADAT
SAID: I BELIEVE, A CHANGE IN ADMINISTRATION MIGHT DELAY
A SOLUTION FOR SOME TIME, BUT IT WILL NOT LEAD TO COMPLICA-
TIONS IN THE U.S. ATTITUDE TOWARD THE MIDDLE EAST QUESTION.
NATURALLY, THE UNITED STATES HAS THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE THE
PRESIDENT IT THINKS MOST SUITABLE FOR IT. WHAT I HAVE
READ ABOUT CARTER SHOWS THAT HE SUPPORTS A PEACEFUL
SOLUTION.
3. I AM SURE THAT AFTER HAVING MET WITH MANY OF THE
POLITICIANS IN THE UNITED STATES AND SEEN THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE--AND I TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO ONCE AGAIN THANK
THEM FOR THE WARM HOSPITALITY ACCORDED US DURING OUR LAST
VISIT AND FOR THEIR REAL SENTIMENTS WHICH HAVE GREATLY
MOVED US--THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT A PEACEFUL
SOLUTION. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ALSO WANTS A PEACEFUL
SOLUTION.
4. IF THERE IS A CHANGE IN ADMINISTRATION AFTER THE
ELECTIONS, THIS WOULD DELAY THE PEACEFUL SOLUTION FOR
SOME TIME AS HAPPENED IN 1974. THE SECOND DISENGAGEMENT
AGREEMENT WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN CONCLUDED IN 1974
AND NOT, AS HAPPENED, IN 1975. BUT IN VIEW OF THE
WATERGATE ISSUE, THE SECOND DISENGAGEMENT AGREEMENT WAS
ELAYED FOR ONE YEAR. I BELIEVE A NEW ADMINISTRATION, IF
THERE SHOULD BE ONE, WILL NEED SOME TIME TO STUDY AND
ABSORB THE WHOLE SITUATION. AFTER THAT, AS I SAID, AND
WHETHER THE NEW PRESIDENT IS DEMOCRATIC OR REPUBLICAN,
THE UNITED STATES WILL HOLD 99 PERCENT OF THE CARDS IN
THE MIDDLE EAST GAME.
5. MR. DEVINE ASKED PRESIDENT AS-SADAT THIS QUESTION:
MR. PRESIDENT, YOU SAID IN FEBRUARY 1974 THAT YOU WOULD
NOT RUN AGAIN FOR THE POST OF PRESIDENT IN EGYPT. WHAT
MADE YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND ABOUT THAT?
6. REPLYING TO A QUESTION ON THE SOLUTION HE WILL OFFER
TO THE MIDDLE EAST PROBLEM CONCERNING GAZA, SHARM ASH-
SHAYKH, THE PALESTINIANS, THE GOLAN HEIGHTS, SINAI, THE
WEST BANK AND THE GULF OF AQABA, PRESIDENT AS-SADAT SAID:
FIRST, WE MUST AGREE ON THE BASIC FACT THAT THE ISRAELIS
MUST WITHDRAW FROM ALL THE TERRITORIES TO THE 1967 BORDERS,
INCLUDING JERUSALEM. WE WILL THEN CONSIDER SINAI.
7. THE PRESIDENT SAID: I WILL AGREE TO THE STATIONING OF
UN FORCES IN SHARM ASH-SHAYKH AFTER THE ISRAELI WITHDRAWL
FROM THERE. THE UN FORCES CAN STAY THERE TO GUARANTEE
THE FREEDOM OF SHIPPING. REGARDING THE OTHER INTER-
NATIONAL GUARANTEES, I AM WILLING TO ACCEPT THE PRESENCE
OF A UN FORCE IN SHARM ASH-SHAYKH. REGARDING OUR BORDER,
I AM ALSO WILLING TO AGREE TO THE PRESENCE OF UN FORCES
THERE ALSO, PROVIDED THAT THEY ARE STATIONED ON BOTH SIDES.
BUT I WILL BE UNDERSTANDING AND CONSIDERATE CONCERNING
THE PROPORTION OF THE AREA TO BE GIVEN FOR THE STATIONING
OF THESE FORCES. IF ISRAEL SHOWS A WILLINGNESS TO SOLVE
THE PALESTINE QUESTION COMPLETELY, ITS SHIPS CAN PASS
THROUGH THE SUEZ CANAL. WE ARE READY FOR THAT IF THEY
AREA ALSO READY FOR IT.;
8. REGARDING THE PALESTINIANS, I REQUEST THE SETTING UP
OF A PALESTINIAN STATE IN THE WEST BANK AND GAZA WITH A
CORRIDOR BETWEEN THEM.
9. REGARDING THE GOLAN, THE SYRIANS CAN SPEAK FOR THEM-
SELVES. ONCE WE HAVE REACHED THIS STAGE, I DO NOT THINK
THAT PRESIDENT AL-ASAD, FOR INSTANCE, WILL OBJECT TO THE
STATIONING OF OBSERVERS ON THE BORDER. BUT THIS IS SOME-
THING ON WHICH I CANNOT DECIDE. IT IS UP TO PRESIDENT
AL-ASAD AND SYRIA.
10. THE GREAT CONCESSION WHICH WE WILL MAKE ONCE THE
COMPLETE ISRAELI WITHDRAWAL FROM ALL THE OCCUPIED ARAB
TERRITORIES TO THE 1967 BORDERS IS ACHIEVED, THE
PALESTINE PROBLEM IS SOLVED AND A PALESTINIAN STATE
ESTABLISHED, IS THAT WE WILL END THE STATE OF WAR,WHICH
HAS EXISTED FOR THE PAST 28 YEARS. WE WILL THEN TRY TO
BUILD LASTING PEACE IN THE WHOLE REGION.
11. COMMENT: YOU WILL NOTE THAT SADAT ACKNOWLEDGES THAT
A POSSIBLE CHANGE IN ADMINISTRATION MIGHT DELAY SOLUTION
FOR A TIME PENDING STIDY OF THE PROBLEM BY A NEW ADMINISTRA-
TION. BY PUBLICLY INDICATING THIS, AND HAVING IT
PUBLISHED IN CAIRO'S DAILY, AKHBAR, HE IS GIVING HIMSELF
SOME BREATHING SPACE IF THINGS DO NOT WORK OUT THE WAY
HE WOULD LIKE, I. E., RE-ELECTION OF PRESIDENT FORD.
SADAT'S SUBSTANTIVE VIEWS ARE NOT NEW. NOR ARE HIS
STATED CONDITIONS FOR ENDING THE STATE OF WAR, E.G.,
ISRAELI WITHDRAWAL AND ESTABLISHMENT OF A PALESTINIAN
STATE. HE IS TAKING A LEAF OUT OF THE ISRAELI BOOK BY
THUS PUBLICLY STATING HIS WILINGNESS TO END THE STATE
OF WAR, BUT STIPULATING HIS PRICE FOR DOING SO AND MAKING IT
CONSISTENT WITH ARAB ASPIRATIONS. IN PART, OF COURSE, THIS IS FOR
GENERAL ARAB CONSUMPTION. HOWEVER, HE IS ALSO SIGNALLING US AND
THE ISRAELIS ONCE AGAIN THE
THE EXISTING ISRAELI OFFER IS
INADEQUATE. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I KNOW OF THAT HE
HAS PUBLICLY SUGGESTED UN CONTROLLED DMZ ON THE BORDERS
MIGHT BE PROPORTIONAL RATHER THAN IDENTICAL IN SIZE,
THOUGH HE MADE THIS STATEMENT TO CODEL OBEY LAST AUGUST.
EARLIER IN THE INTERVIEW SADAT REAFFIRMED HIS BELIEF GENEVA IS BEST
FORUM TO BEGIN INITIAL TALKS AND THAT PLO SHOULD BE REPRESENTED.

ON ENTEBBE AIRPORT
1. DEPUTY MINISTER OF DEFENSE AND FOREIGN
AFFAIRS, LAKSHMAN
JAYAKODY, ISSUED STATEMENT JULY 6 WHICH CONDEMNED THE
ISRAELI RESCUE OF HOSTAGES AT ENTEBBE AIRPORT "AS AN ACT OF
AGGRESSION AND A GRAVE VIOLATION OF THE SOVEREIGNITY OF
UGANDA AND NEIGHBORING STATES." STATEMENT ALSO STRESSED,
HOWEVER,THAT SRI LANKA DID NOT CONDONE THE HIJACKING OF

2. TEXT OF STATEMENT IS: "WE DO NOT CONDONE THE HIJACKING
OF PLANES OR THE HOLDING OF HOSTAGES FOR POLITICAL GAINS
WITH CONSEQUENT RISK TO INNOCENT HUMAN LIVES.
"AT THE SAME TIME WE WISH EXPRESS ONCE AGAIN OUR SUPPORT
FOR THE CAUSE OF THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE. SRI LANKA HAS

VIOLATION ON THE OSVEREITNITY OF UGANDA AND NEIGHBORING
STATES. WE FULLY SUPPORT THE POSITION TAKEN UP ON THIS

3. COMMENT: STATEMENT APPEARS TO BE ATTEMPT TO PROMOTE
SRI LANKA'S IMAGE AMONG NON-ALINGED. WHILE IT ALSO REITERATES
SRI LANKA'S STRONG SUPPORT FOR PALESTINIAN
CAUSE, DISCLAIMER AT VERY START INDICATES CEYLONESE WANT
TO AVOID ANY IMPLICATION THAT THEY CONDONE OR SUPPORT

 * 170770 1976PORTL00595 0.007096018 | 1976-07-06 | PORT LOUIS | STATE | 13TH ORDINARY OAU SUMMIT ENDS IN SUPERFICIAL AND ONLY PARTIAL AFRICAN  UNITY
ONLY PARTIAL AFRICAN UNITY
SUMMARY: THE OAU SUMMIT, ALREADY EMBROILED IN CONTROVERSY OVER
THE DJIBOUTI ISSUE AND TO AN EVEN GREATER EXTENT WESTERN SAHARA,
WAS BADLY SHAKEN BY THE ISRAELI COMMANDO ACTION IN UGANDA AND THE
SUDANESE COUP ATTEMPT. NEVERTHELESS, THE 13TH ORDINARY OAU SUMMIT
ENDED EARLY ON JULY 6 UNITED IN ITS CONDEMNATION OF ISRAEL'S
ACTION IN ENTEBBE, IN ITS CRITICISM OF FRANCE FOR ITS MAYOTTE
POLICY AND FOR THE SALE OF NUCLEAR REACTORS TO SOUTH AFRICA.
MORE DIFFICULT ISSUES INVOLVING THE INDIVIDUAL NATIONAL INTERESTS
OF AFRICAN STATES (SUCH AS LOS, CERTAIN TYPES OF RELATIONS WITH
SOUTH AFRICA, ETC.) WERE SENT TO STUDY COMMITTEES WHERE DECISIONS
ON THEM COULD BE POSTPONED UNTIL AT LEAST THE FEBRUARY 1977
COUNCIL OF MINISTERS IN ADDIS. ALL FOUR OAU ASSISTANT SECRETARIES
GENERAL WERE ASKED TO REMAIN UNTIL THE END OF ADMIN SECRETARY
GENERAL WILLIAM ETEKI MBOUMOUA'S TERM IS COMPLETED IN 1978. AT
THAT TIME, THE SECRETARIAT WILL BE DIVIDED INTO FIVE ASSISTANT
SECRETARY GENERALSHIPS, EACH ONE REPRESENTING A DIFFERENT
GEOGRAPHICAL AREA. THE DJIBOUTI RESOLUTION PASSED UNANIMOUSLY
WITHOUT SPECIFIC SOMALI RESERVATION. THE SUMMIT DECIDED TO CALL AN
EXTRAORDINARY OAU SUMMIT TO DEAL WITH THE PROBLEM OF WESTERN
SAHARA. DELEGATES HOPED THIS EXTRAORDINARY SUMMIT WOULD BE HELD
WITHIN ONE MONTH BUT CERTAINLY BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR. END
SUMMARY.
1. OAU DELEGATES UNANIMOUSLY CRITICIZED ISRAEL FOR THE COMMANDO
OPERATION IN ENTEBBE. KENYAN VICE PRESIDENT ARAP MOI MADE A
STATEMENT DENOUNCING ISRAELI AGGRESSION AND CLAIMING THAT KENYA
WAS "AGGRESSED" AGAINST BY ISRAEL AS WELL. HE TRACED THE PROBABLE
ISRAELI FLIGHT PATH, AND STATED THAT ISRAEL HAD PROBABLY VIOLATED
THE AIRSPACE OF OTHER AFRICAN AND ARAB COUNTRIES. COMMENT:
ALTHOUGH TACIT KENYAN SUPPORT FOR THE ISRAELI OPERATION WAS
GENERALLY ACKNOWLEDGED PRIVATELY BY OAU DELEGATES, THERE WAS NO
PUBLIC OR OVERT CRITICISM OF KENYA OVER THE OPERATION OTHER THAN
AMIN'S MESSAGE TO THE CONFERENCE READ BY HIS REPRESENTATIVE.
END COMMENT.
2. IN AN EARLIER STATEMENT UGANDAN FORMIN LT. COL. JUMA ORIS DE-
SCRIBED THE ISRAELI ACTION WHICH HAD DESTROYED 7 MIG 21'S, 4 MIG
17'S AND SEVERAL CIVILIAN AIRCRAFT. ACCORDING TO ORIS "THE TREACH-
EROUS ATTACK WAS LAUNCHED AND DIRECTED FROM THE SOIL OF THE NEIGH-
BORING STATE OF KENYA." ORIS CALLED FOR TOTAL CONDEMNATION OF AN
AFRICAN STATE WHICH WOULD PROVIDE "HER TERRITORY TO ZIONIST AND
COLONIST COMMANDOS TO INVADE ANOTHER AFRICAN STATE".
3. LIBERIA SPONSORED AND THE SUMMIT ADOPTED A RESOLUTION
EXPRESSING DEEP ALARM AT THE "ISRAELI AGGRESSION" WHICH IT HELD
TO BE A THREAT TO INTERNATIONAL PEACE. SUCH AGGRESSION, THE
RESOLUTION CONTINUED, IS THE RESULT OF ISRAELI-SOUTH AFRICAN
COOPERATION WHICH LIBERIA STRONGLY CONDEMNED. THE ISRAELI AGGRESS-
ION "THWARTED" PRESIDENT AMIN'S HUMANITARIAN EFFORTS TO OBTAIN THE
HOSTAGES' RELEASE, THE RESOLUTION SAID.
4. THE SUMMIT AGREED THAT A SPECIAL OAU SUMMIT WOULD BE HELD TO
DISCUSS THE PROBLEM OF WESTERN SAHARA. IT WAS HOPED THAT THIS
MEETING WOULD BE HELD WITHIN ONE MONTH BUT AT THE LATEST BEFORE THE
END OF THE YEAR. AFTER THE JULY 3 COUNCIL OF MINISTER'S VOTE TO
RECONSIDER THE WESTERN SAHARA QUESTION, MOROCCAN DELEGATES REFUSED
TO TAKE PART IN SUMMIT DELIBERATIONS. MAURITANIAN PRESIDENT OULD
DADDAH, HOWEVER, REMAINED AND STAUNCHLY DEFENDED THE MOROCCAN-
MAURITANIAN POSITION.
5. THE SUMMIT ACCEPTED WITHOUT CHANGE THE DRAFT RESOLUTION ON
DJIBOUTI WHICH CALLS UPON ALL STATES TO REFRAIN FROM INTERFERING
IN FTAI INTERNAL AFFAIRS AND TO ABSTAIN FROM ANY ACTION LIKELY TO
IMPEDE OR ADVERSELY AFFECT PROGRESS TOWARD INDEPENDENCE. THE
RESOLUTION URGES ALL POLITICAL PARTIES AND GROUPS AS WELL AS THE
TWO LIBERATION MOVEMENTS RECOGNIZED BY THE OAU TO HOLD A ROUND-
TABLE CONFERENCE ON NEUTRAL GROUND UNDER OAU AUSPICES IN ORDER TO
DEVELOP A COMMON POLITICAL PLATFORM BEFORE AN INDEPENDENCE
REFERENDUM. IT DIRECTS THE OAU FACT-FINDING MISSION TO OBSERVE
THE REFERENDUM AND SUBSEQUENT ELECTIONS AND TO ASSIST IN THE
DETERMINATION OF REFUGEE STATUS ON THE BASIS OF THE FACT-FINDING
MISSION'S RECOMMENDATIONS. IN THIS REGARD, THE PROPOSED ROUNDTABLE
CONFERENCE WILL PROBABLY BE HELD AT ACCRA DURING THE FIRST HALF
OF AUGUST.
6. ALL FOUR OAU ASSISTANT SECRETARIES GENERAL WERE ASKED TO
REMAIN IN THEIR POSITIONS UNTIL 1978 SO THAT THEIR TENURE WOULD
COINCIDE WITH THAT OF OAU ADMIN SECRETARY GENERAL ETEKI. AT THAT
TIME, THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE FOUR ASSISTANT SECRETARIES
GENERAL WILL BE DIVIDED AMONG FIVE REGIONS TO INCLUDE THE NEWLY
AGREED UPON SOUTHERN AFRICAN REGION. (THE OTHER FOUR REGIONS ARE
NORTHERN, WESTERN, EASTERN AND CENTRAL AFRICA).
7. ALTHOUGH IT IS TOO EARLY TO PREDICT THE FINAL REACTION OF OAU
MEMBERS TO THE ISRAELI ACTION IN UGANDA, IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THEY
WILL GO BEYOND THE RITUAL CONDEMNATION MADE AT THE SUMMIT.
MOST PROBABLY, NIGERIAN FORMIN GARBA'S STATEMENT (CF PORT LOUIS
576) WILL HOLD TRUE: THERE IS LITTLE SUB-SAHARAN AFRICAN INTEREST
IN EXPULSION OF ISRAEL FROM THE UNITED NATIONS. AS FAR AS WE
COULD TELL, OTHER MULTILATERAL ISSUES, SUCH AS PUERTO RICO AND
KOREA, WERE TOTALLY MISSING FROM THE OAU DELIBERATIONS.
8. COMMENT: THE 13TH ORDINARY SUMMIT HAD THE SMALLEST ATTENDANCE
OF AFRICAN HEADS OF STATE AND GOVERNMENT ON RECORD. (BONGO OF
GABON, JAWARA OF GAMBIA, SENGHOR OF SENEGAL, KAUNDA OF ZAMBIA,
OULD DADDAH OF MAURITANIA, NIMEIRI OF SUDAN, RAMGOOLAM OF
MAURITIUS, MANCHAM OF SEYCHELLES, AMIN OF UGANDA, TEFERI OF
ETHIOPIA.) DECISIONS ON DIFFICULT AND DIVISIVE ISSUES SUCH AS
LOS AND CERTAIN RELATIONS WITH SOUTH AFRICA WERE POSTPONED. AN
EXCEPTION WAS THE RESOLUTION ON DJIBOUTI WHERE ALL AFRICAN NATIONS
COULD AGREE ON THE PRINCIPLE OF NON-INTERFERENCE AND INDEPENDENCE
FOR THE TERRITORY. THE WESTERN SAHARA ISSUE, HOWEVER, ALMOST SPLIT
THE CONFERENCE. WESTERN SAHARA REMAINS A BURNING PROBLEM AND MUST
BE DEALT WITH SOON. DELEGATES AND SECRETARIAT MEMBERS WORKED
DILIGENTLY AND WITH DEDICATION BUT REPEATEDLY ADMITTED TO EMBOFF
AND OTHER "OUTSIDERS" THAT THE OAU IS PRIMARILY INVOLVED IN "BLAH-
BLAH" (USELESS TALK) INSTEAD OF CONCRETE, DECISIVE AND PRODUCTIVE
MATTERS.

TOLD US JULY 6 OF NEW MOVES BY THE SOVIET AUTHORITIES
TO KEEP DOWN THE NUMBER OF POTENTIAL JEWISH EMIGRANTS.
IN ODESSA, OUR SOURCES SAY, THE POSTAL AUTHORITIES
HAVE BEEN TOLD TO GIVE ALL VYZOVS WHICH THEY RECEIVE
TO THE POLICE. THE LATTER CALL IN THE ADDRESSESS AND
ASK FIRST IF HE HAS ANY RELATIVES IN ISRAEL. IF THE
ANSWER IS NO (EITHER FROM FEAR OF REVEALING THIS FACT
OR BECAUSE THERE ARE NONE), THE VYZOV IS THROWN AWAY.
IF THE ANSWER IS YES, THE NEXT QUESTION IS TO ASK FOR
THE NAME OF THE RELATIVE. THE VYZOV IS DISCARDED IF
THE NAME DOES NOT CORRESPOND TO THAT GIVEN BY THE
ADDRESSEE. IF THE NAMES CORRESPOND, THE ADDRESSEE
IS THEN ASKED ABOUT THE NATURE OF THE RELATIONSHIP. HE
GETS HIS VYZOV ONLY IF THE RELATIONSHIP CORRESPONDS.
3. OUR SOURCES REPORT THAT THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE
POLICE IN ODESSA HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR ABOUT A MONTH.
THEY OBSERVE RUEFULLY THAT THIS APPROACH GIVES THE
AUTHORITIES SEVERAL ADVANTAGES (AND ADD THAT IT IS
ODD THAT THE AUTHORITIES HAD NOT PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT
OF THIS TACTIC). FIRST, THERE IS THE NATURAL FEAR
OF ANY SOVIET CITIZEN TO HAVE ANY CONFRONTATION WITH
THE POLICE. MORE SIGNIFICANTLY, HOWEVER, GIVEN THE
LARGE NUMBRS OF WHOLLY OR PARTIALLY FALSE ISRAELI
VYZOVS (FICATIONAL RELATIVES OR A FICTITIOUS RELATION-
SHIP), THIS POLICY, IF EXTENDED TO THE USSR AS A WHOLE,
WOULD GREATLY REDUCE THE POTENTIAL POOL OF JEWS ABLE
TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS FOR EMIGRATION. OUR SOURCES
SAY THAT THEY, AND BY IMPLICATION THE JEWISH COMMUNITY
AS A WHOLE, ARE EXTREMELY CONCERNED ABOUT THE IMPLICA-
TIONS OF AN EXTENSION OF THE ODESSAN APPROACH.
4. AZBEL AND BRAYLOVSKIY ALSO REPORT THAT ONLY ONE
VYZOV HAS, TO THEIR KNOWLEDGE, BEEN RECEIVED IN KHARKOV
IN THE LAST TWO MONTHS. THEY SAU THAT SEVERAL KHARKOV
JEWS HAD RECEIVED CABLES OR TELEPHONE CALLS FROM
ABROAD INFORMING THEM THAT VYZOVS WERE ON THE WAY, BUT
ONLY ONE HAS GOTTEN THROUGH. THEY ADDED THAT THE
RECIPIENT OF THE VYZOV TREATED THE EVENT AS THE OCCASION
FOR A PARTY, AND IT WAS THEN, ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO, THAT
IT BECAME CLEAR JUST HOW BAD THE EMIGRATION SITUATION
HAD BECOME IN THAT CITY. (THERE ARE ALMOST 77,000 JEWS
IN KHARKOV OBLAST, ACCORDING TO THE 1970 CENSUS.)
5. OTHER RELIABLE SOURCES REPORT THAT THE NEW DEFINITION
OF FAMILY, I.X. FOR THE PURPOSE OF EMIGRATION, A FAMILY
TO BE "REUNIFIED" WOULD BE CONSIDERED AS HUSBAND, WIFE,
AND UNMARRIED (OR MINOR) CHILDREN -- IS BEING APPLIED NOT
ONLY IN MOSCOW (SEE MOSCOW 10146) BUT ALSO IN KIEV,
KISHINEV AND NOVOSIBIRSK. THESE SOURCES CAUTION THAT
THEY HAVE STILL NOT SEEN EVIDENCE THAT THE NEW DEFINITION
WILL BE APPLIED ON AN ALL-UNION BASIS. OUR SOURCES
CLAIM THAT SEVERAL OVIR HAVE SAID THAT THE NEW POLICY
FULLY ACCORDS WITH THE HELSINKI PRINCIPLES AND WILL BE
APPLIED IN THE FUTURE. THEY NOTE THAT IT WOULD BE
IN KEEPING WITH THE CUSTOMARY SOVIET APPROACH TO SUCH
MATTERS THAT THEY DECIDE TO MAKE THEIR POLICY ON JEWISH
EMIGRATION MORE STRICT WHILE AT THE SAME TIME WRAPPING
THEMSELVES IN THE CSCE FINAL ACT.
6. OUR SOURCES SAY THAT IF THEY CAN GET
EVIDENCE OF A CHANGE TOWARD GREATER RESTRICTIVENESS IN
DEGREE OF CONSANGUINUITY, THE JEWISH "REFUSENIK"
LEADERSHIP WILL ENDEAVOR TO MOUNT A CAMPAIGN IN THE WEST,
ESPECIALLY IN THE U.S. THEY TELL US THAT THEY FEEL
THE NEWLY-CREATED U.S. CONGRESSIONAL
CSCE COULD BE USEFUL COMMISSION IN THIS EFFORT. THEY
ADD THAT THE AMERICAN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION CAMPAIGN
MIGHT ALSO PROVIDE THEM WITH OPPORTUNITIES TO
MAKE THEIR POINT.
7. COMMENT: IF THESE RESTRICTIVE MEASURES ARE INDEED
TO BE APPLIED ON AN ALL-UNION BASIS, IT WOULD MAKE THE
SITUATION OF THE WOULD-BE EMIGRANT EVEN MORE DIFFI-
CULT THAN IT ALREADY SI. APPLICATION OF THE ODESSA AND
THE "CSCE DEFINITION" MEASURES UNDOUBTEDLY WOULD
DIMINISH THE NUMBER OF SOVIET JEWS ABLE EVEN
TO APPLY SUCCESSFULLY FOR EMIGRATION. WE FEEL IT QUITE
POSSIBLE THAT WIDER USE OF THE MEASURES WOULD CAUSE THE
REFUSENIKS TO TRY TO ORGANIZE A CAMPAIGN.
8. IN THIS CONNECTION, WE NOTE THAT THE INFORMATION
WE REPORT HERE HAS COME FROM SEVERAL OF THE DIFFERENT
GROUPS THAT MAKE UP THE REFUSENIK COMMUNITY. WHILE
THESE GROUPS TEND TO BE MUTUALLY ANTIPATHETIC,
RESTRICTIONS ON EMIGRATION AND A GENERALIZED TIGHTENING
UP ON THE PROCEDURES COULD WELL PROVIDE THE IMPETUS FOR
THEM TO UNITE. THE REFUSENIK GROUPS NORMALLY HAVE
SEPARATE LINES OF COMMUNICATION TO DIFFERENT WESTERN
ORGANIZATIONS AND PROMINENT INDIVIDUALS: AN AGREEMENT
TO COORDINATE ACTION IN THE USSR AND IN THE WEST COULD
RESULT IN AN UNUSUALLY VIGOROUS CAMPAIGN.

** 309214 1976TELAV04606 0.007090061 | 1976-07-04 | TEL AVIV | STATE USUN NEW YORK | RABIN KNESSET STATEMENT ON ISRAELI ACTION IN UGANDA SUMMARY
SUMMARY
1.  PRIME MINISTER RABIN, AT SPECIAL KNESSET SESSION AT 3PM ON JULY
4, DELIVERED FIFTEEN MINUTE STATEMENT TO PACKED CHAMBER ON GOI
DECISIONS AND IDF ACTIVITY AT ENTEBBE AIRPORT ON NIGHT OF JULY 3-4.
HIS MAIN POINT WAS THAT ISRAELI GOVERNMENT BEARS EXCLUSIVE RESPON-
SIBILITY FOR THE RESCUE OPERATION.  ALL KNESSET PARTIES EXCEPT RAKAH
COMMUNISTS ADOPTED RESOLUTION PRAISING THE IDF ACTION.  FOLLOWING
ARE HIGHLIGHTS.  END SUMMARY.
2.  THE ISRAELI DEFENSE FORCES (IDF), RABIN SAID, HAD CARRIED OUT
WITH GREAT HEROISM THE GOVERNMENT'S DECISION TO RESCUE THE HOSTAGES
ON THE AIR FRANCE AIRCRAFT AT ENTEBBE AIRPORT.  THREE ISRAELIS, TWO
CIVILIAN HOSTAGES AND THE MILITARY COMMANDER, HAD BEEN KILLED.
(RABIN DID NOT SPECIFY UGANDAN OR TERRORIST CASUALTIES).  THIS WAS ON
E
OF THE FINEST OPERATIONS IN THE IDF'S HISTORY, AND ONE OF WHICH ALL
ISRAELIS COULD BE JUSTIFIABLY PROUD.
3.  THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT ALONE BEARS THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS
RESCUE OPERATION WHICH WAS NOT COORDINATED WITH ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT.
HOWEVER, ALL GOVERNMENTS MUST WORK TOGETHER IN THE CONTINUING
STRUGGLE AGAINST INTERNATIONAL AIR TERRORISM.
4.  RABIN REVIEWED DEVELOPMENT OF EVENTS SINCE START OF HIJACKING
INCIDENT, EMPHASIZING THE UNIQUE DIFFICULTIES CONFRONTING THE GOI
IN DEALING WITH SITUATION INVOLVING GOVERNMENT OF UGANDA WITH WHICH
ISRAEL DOES NOT HAVE DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS.  FROM THE OUTSET, THERE
WAS FULL POLITICAL COORDINATION WITH THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT FOR THE
RELEASE OF THE HOSTAGES.  IT BECAME CLEAR DURING THE WEEK THAT A) A
MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THE TERRORISTS WAS TO KEEP THE ISRAELI PASSENGERS
HOSTAGES AND B) IDI AMIN, THE HEAD OF THE UGANDAN GOVERNMENT, WAS
COOPERATING WITH THE TERRORISTS.
5.  ON JULY 1, THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT DECLARED ITS READINESS TO NE-
GOTIATE AN EXCHANGE OF PRISONERS FOR THE RELEASE OF THE HOSTAGES.
THIS WAS NOT A PHONY DEVICE TO BUY TIME.  THE GOI WAS PREPARED TO
IMPLEMENT ITS JULY 1 DECISION.
6.  SIMULTANEOUSLY, HOWEVER, THE IDF FORMULATED ITS PLANS FOR A RESCU
E
OPERATION.  IN THE LAST PHASE, THE GOI UNANIMOUSLY AUTHORIZED THE IDF
TO CARRY OUT THIS OPERATION.  THE GOVERNMENT MAINTAINED FULL CONSUL-
TATIONS AND BRIEFINGS WITH THE KNESSET FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND SECURITY
COMMITTEE THROUGHOUT THE VARIOUS STAGES OF DECISION-MAKING.
7.  THIS RESCUE OPERATION CONSTITUTES ISRAEL'S CONTRIBUTION TO THE
INTERNATIONAL FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM.  BUT THIS STRUGGLE IS FAR FROM
FINISHED AND IT WILL REQUIRE CONTINUING VIGILANCE AND ACTION.  IN
CLOSING, RABIN AGAIN NOTED THAT THE RESCUE OPERATION WAS ONE OF THE
GREATEST ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE IDF.
8.  LIKUD OPPOSITION LEADER, BEGIN SAID THAT ISRAEL HAD NOT HAD
NATIONAL UNITY AS GREAT AS IT ENJOYED TODAY SINCE ITS VICTORY IN THE
1967 WAR.  HE PAID THIBUTE TO THE IDF, AND EXPRESSED CONDOLENCES TO
THE ISRAELI VICTIMS.  CONGRATULATING RABIN FOR HIS LEADERSHIP, BEGIN
SAID THAT RESCUE OPERATION HAD FULL SUPPORT OF THE LIKUD, AND THAT IN
THIS MOMENT INTERNAL POLITICAL DIFFERENCES WERE TRANSCENDED BY SENSE
OF NATIONAL UNITY.  BEGIN URGED FORMATION OF SPECIAL COMMANDO UNIT TO
COMBAT TERRORISM.  HE COMPARED TERRORISTS TO NAZIS, AND MADE SHARP
ATTACK ON SOVIETS FOR SUPPLYING UGANDA'S RACIST DICTATOR WITH MIGS
AND OTHER EQUIPMENT.  HE WARNED ARABS THAT ISRAEL WILL NOT BE PASSIVE
IN CONFRONTING ITS ENEMIES, ALTHOUGH IT SEEKS TO LIVE IN PEACE WITH
ITS NEIGHBORS.
9.  AT CLOSE OF 45 MINUTE SESSION, ALL PARTIES EXCEPT RAKAH COMMU-
NISTS ADOPTED RESOLUTION EXPRESSING APPRECIATION TO IDF, CONDOLENCES
TO ISRAELI DEAD, AND QUICK RECOVERY FOR THE WOUNDED.
10.  COMMENT:  CABINET AND KNESSET MEMBERS WERE OBVIOUSLY RELIEVED
AT END OF WEEK LONG ORDEAL AND NEAR-JUBILANT OVER ITS OUTCOME.
SUCCESSFUL RESCUE OPERATION HAS GIVEN STRONG BOOST TO PUBLIC MORALE
AND CERTAINLY STRENTHENED RABIN GOVERNMENT'S DOMESTIC POSITION.  IN
CONVERSATION WITH EMBOFF, KNESSET MEMBERS EXPRESSED APPRECIATION FOR
PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE WHICH HAD ALREADY RECEIVED WIDE DISSEMINATION.

 * 67043 1976DUBLIN01309 0.007089058 | 1976-07-06 | DUBLIN | STATE | IRISH HOTELS BOMBED
1. FOUR HOTELS IN THE IRISH REPUBLIC WERE BOMBED JULY 3 IN AN
ACTION THAT APPEARS TO BE RETALIATION FOR KILLINGS OF PROTESTANT
BUSINESSMEN IN NORTHERN IRELAND.  THE BOMBINGS WERE PRECEDED
BY A TELEPHONE WARNING FROM A MAN WITH A NORTHERN IRISH ACCENT WHO
IDENTIFIED HIMSELF AS "CAPTAIN BLACK OF THE ULSTER FREEDOM
FIGHTERS."  FOUR PERSONS WERE INJURED IN THE BOMBINGS; FURTUNATELY,
ONE SERIOUSLY.
2. THE FOLLOWING ARE THE FOUR HOTELS THAT WERE BOMBED:
A) DUBLIN'S GRESHAM HOTEL WERE 25 LBS OF GELIGNITE WERE
HIDDEN IN A LINEN CLOSET ON SECOND FLOOR.  NONE OF THE 200
GUESTS OR 150 STAFF OF THIS LUXURY HOTEL WAS INJURED, ALTHOUGH
SOME WERE TREATED FOR SHOCK.
B) ROSSLARE'S GREAT SOUTHERN HOTEL. A SUITCASE OF EXPLOSIVES
WAS LEFT IN A PARKING BAY UNDER THE HOTEL.  SIXTEEN OF THE
HOTEL'S 100 BEDROOMS WERE DAMAGED.  THREE PERSONS WERE TREATED
FOR SHOCK.
C) LIMERICK'S ROYAL GEORGE HOTEL. A 10 LB BOMB CAUSED CONSIDERABLE
DAMAGE AND INJURED A TEN YEAR OLD BOY.
D) KILLARNEY'S TORC GREAT SOUTHERN HOTEL. GUESTS HAD BEEN
EVACUATED WHEN THE BOMB EXPLODED NEAR A TANK OF BUTANEGAS.
FORTUNATELY, THE GAS WAS NOT IGNITED.
3. THE BOMBINGS CAUSED SHOCK AND DISMAY THROUGHOUT THE
REPUBLIC OF IRELAND, AND ONE OF THE MAIN CONCERNS EXPRESSED
IN THE IRISH NEWSPAPERS WAS THAT OF THE EFFECT OF THE BOMBINGS
ON TOURISM AND INVESTMENT. THE TOURIST SEASON IN IRELAND HAD
GOTTEN OFF TO A GOOD START THIS YEAR, AND IRISH TOURIST OFFICIALS
WERE HOPING FOR A SHARP INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF TOURISTS
THIS YEAR.  TOURIST BOARD OFFICIALS FEAR THAT MANY CANCELLATIONS
WILL RESULT FROM THE BOMBINGS.  ONE HIGH LEVEL TOURIST
OFFICIAL PRIVATELY COMMENTED TO AN EMBASSY OFFICER THAT THE
ISRAELI RAID IN UGANDA MAY HAVE BEEN OF SOME HELP IN THIS
RESPECT, INASMUCH AS IT PUSHED THE NEWS OF THE IRISH BOMBINGS TO
THE INSIDE PAGES OF THE NEWSPAPERS.  NEVERTHELESS, THE
BOMBINGS WILL UNDOUBTEDLY HAVE SOME EFFECT ON TOURISM, ALTHOUGH
THE EXTENT IS DIFFCICULT TO ASSESS AT THIS TIME.  A SOUTHAMPTON
SOCCER CLUB HAS ALREADY CANCELLED TWO MATCHES THAT WERE TO HAVE
BEEN PLAYED IN IRELAND AT THE END OF JULY - A NUMBER OF TEAM
MEMBERS REPORTEDLY REFUSED TO TRAVEL.
4. THE GOVERNMENT IS REVIEWING THE SECURITY SITUATION AND
SECURITY MEASURES IN BORDER AREAS ARE REPORTEDLY BEING
INTENSIFIED. CURLEY

1. PRIVATE REACTION OF NEPALESE LEADERSHIP TO RECENT
ISRAELI RAID AGAINST ENTEBBE AIRPORT IS NEARLY UNIVERSAL
IN ITS ACCLAIM. FOREING MINISTRY OFFICIALS EXPRESSED RELIEF
AND GRATITUDE FOR ISRAEILI DECISION, ALTHOUGH THEY ALSO
OFFERED VIEW THAT "TERRORISTS WILL BE OBLIGED TO RETALIATE".
ONE RUSSIAN DIPLOMAT AT JULY 4TH RECEPTION WAS OBSERVED
TO REMARK QUIETLY TO ISRAELI AMBASSADOR THAT "ALTHOUGH I
CAN'T SAY SO PUBLICLY, MY HEARTIEST CONGRATUALTIONS."
TWO PROMINENT LEFTIS NEPALESE POLITICIANS ALSO TOD EMBOFF
THAT THEY THOUGHT ISRAEL SHOULD BE CONGRATULATED BY WORLD
FOR ITS PROMPT AND DECISIVE ATTACK, BUT BOTH ADMITTED THEY
COULD NOT MAKE SUCH STATEMENTS PUBLICLY.
2. EDITORIAL COMMENT HAS BEEN BALANCED. SEMI-OFFICIAL
DAILY RISING NEPAL OFFERED VIEW THAT RAID WILL
STRENGTHEN THE VIEW OF "NO COMPROMISE HARD LINE
IN DEALING WITH HIJACKERS... AND COULD THUS
LEAD TO DISCOURAGING WOULD-BE-HIJACKERS" IN
FUTURE. PAPER ALSO NOTES, HOWEVER, THAT RAID
WAS CLEAR VIOLATION OF UGANDAN SOVEREIGNTY CARRIED
OUT WITH ASSITANCE OF KENYA, FACT WHICH WILL
HAVE SERIOUS REPERCUSSIONS FOR POLITICS IN AFRICA.

IS LIEKLY TO PERSIST AS LONG AS ROOT CAUSES

** 309223 1976TELAV04644 0.007088881 | 1976-07-06 | TEL AVIV | STATE | TRAFFIC ACROSS THE ISRAELI/LEBANESE BORDER
1.  DURING JULY 6 MEETING WITH AMBASSADOR TOON AND DIRECTOR
OF SSM, KONTOS, MINDEF PERES DISCUSSED SITUATION ON ISRAEL'S
BORDERS.  HE MADE POINT THAT BORDER CONDITIONS ARE REMARKABLE
GIVEN FACT THAT A STATE OF WAR STILL EXISTS BETWEEN ISRAEL
AND HER NEIGHBORS.  PERES CALLED THE EGYPTIAN FRONTIER
"PEACEFUL," STRESSED THE "OPEN BRIDGES" POLICY ON THE
JORDANIAN FRONTIER, AND DESCRIBED THE LEBANESE BORDER AS
"THE MOST PEACEFUL FRONTIER IN THE WORLD."
2.  FROM HIS DESCRIPTION IT SEEMS CLEAR THAT THERE IS A
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TRAFFIC ACROSS THIS BORDER.  PERES
CLAIMS THAT WELL OVER A THOUSAND LEBANESE HAVE CROSSED INTO
ISRAEL FOR MEDICAL TREATMENT.  MOST ARE TREATED AND RETURN
IMMEDIATELY TO LEBANON.  SOME HOWEVER, ARE ADMITTED TO
ISRAELI HOSPITALS WHERE THEY STAY AS LONG AS REQUIRED.
THESE LATTER INCLUDE CASUALTIES OF THE FIGHTING AS WELL
AS WOMEN ABOUT TO GIVE BIRTH.  THE IDF HAS ESTABLISHED
CLINICS NEAR THE BORDER, BUT PERES ASSERTED THAT CIVILIAN
HOSPITALS ARE NOW COMPETING TO SEND PEOPLE AND EQUIPMENT
AS WELL.
3.  THIS WHOLE PROGRAM STARTED SLOWLY, WITH SMALL NUMBERS OF
LEBANESE CHRISTIANS CROSSING FOR MEDICAL TREATMENT, BUT
SOON MUSLIMS WERE ASKING IF ISRAEL WAS DISCRIMINATING AGAINST
THEM.  CHRISTIANS AND MUSLIMS NOW CROSSING IN INCREASING
NUMBERS.  PERES CLAIMED THAT NOW FATAH SUPPORTERS ARE ALSO
CROSSING FOR TREATMENT.  DECISION TO PUBLICIZE THIS
PROGRAM RESULTED FROM REQUEST OF LEBANESE PEOPLE INVOLVED.
4.  TRAFFIC IS  NOT RESTRICTED TO MEDICAL PATIENTS, ACCORDING
TO PERES.  LEBANESE ARE BUYING FOOD FROM ISRAELIS AND
ISRAELIS ARE BUYING TOBACCO FROM LEBANESE FARMERS.  IN
RESPONSE TO A REQUEST FROM THE LEBANESE PEOPLE, THE IDF HAS
LAID A WATER PIPELINE INTO SOUTHERN LEBANON AND IS PUMPING
ISRAELI WATER TO THAT AREA.  LEBANESE PEOPLE REQUESTED ON JULY 5
THAT ISRAEL OPEN A "SUPERMARKET" ON THE BORDER, WHICH PERES SAID
ISRAEL IS PREPARED TO DO.
5.  MOST STRIKING POINT WAS PERES' ASSERTION THAT A LEBANESE
VILLAGE (POPULATION 6,000 CHRISTIANS) SENT A RESOLUTION TO
THE GOI, REQUESTING THAT IT BE ANNEXED BY ISRAEL.  PERES
LAUGHINGLY SAID THAT GOI'S ANSWER WAS "WE'VE GOT ENOUGH
PROBLEMS WITH THE U.S. WITHOUT BITING OFF THIS ONE."

PERES ON JULY 6.  AFTER AN EXCHANGE OF PLEASANTRIES, PERES
HEAPED PRAISE ON THE SINAI FIELD MISSION.  IN HIS VIEW, NO
OTHER ONE SINGLE ELEMENT OF THE SINAI II AGREEMENT HAD DONE
AS MUCH AS THE SFM TO REDUCE TENSIONS IN THE SINAI.  HE FELT
THAT INTERPOSITION OF U.S. PERSONNEL WAS AN IMPORTANT PERCEDENT
AND HE SPECULATED THAT IT COULD SERVE AS USEFUL MODEL FOR
SIMILAR FUTURE ARRANGEMENT BETWEEN ISRAELI AND SYRIAN FORCES
ON THE GOLAN AND PERHAPS BETWEEN ISRAELI AND JORDANIAN
FORCES AS WELL.  PERES STRESSED THAT ONE IMPORTANT ADVANTAGE
OF U.S. PRESENCE IS THAT IT AVOIDS SEMI-ANNUAL TRAUMA
ASSOCIATED WITH RENEWALS OF U.N. MANDATES.
2.  PERES ADMITTED THAT IT WAS LARGELY AT HIS INSISTENCE
THAT THE ISSUE OF U.S. TECHNICIANS WAS INCLUDED IN SINAI
II.  HE ASSERTED THAT WHEN AGREEMENT WAS SIGNED, HE WAS
VIEWED BY HIS COLLEAGUES AS THE FATHER OF A VERY UNWELCOME
BABY, BUT CLAIMS THAT MOST CRITICS HAVE NOW COME AROUND
AND APPRECIATE THE VALUE OF THE SFM.
3.  IN CLOSING, PERES REFERRED TO AN OPINION POLL CONDUCTED
BY THE 1976 NATIONAL CONFERENCE ON GREAT DECISIONS IN
UNITED STATES FOREIGN POLICY.  POLL, TABULATED AS OF
APRIL 20, 1976, RESULTED IN 6,571 BALLOTS.  ON QUESTION OF
U.S. TECHNICIANS IN SINAI. 4,450 WERE IN FAVOR, 1,401 AGAINST

PLEASED, AT THIS OVERWHELMING PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR THE

AREAS SPEAKING OPENLY OF "DECENTRALIZATION" AND
"REGIONALIZATION," IF NOT YET OF EXPLOSIVE TERM "PARTITION."
5. FR TUTOJS "CONSTITUTIONAL DOCUMENT" OF FEBRUARY 14 ONCE AGAIN
UNDER ATTACK, THIS TIME BY "ASSOCIATION OF THE ANCIENTS OF
MAKASSED" WHICH CALLS DOCUMENT " AN AMALGAM OF CONTRADICTORY
IDEAS." GROUP SAYS DOCUMENT IS INAPPLICABLE AND FRANGIE
COMMITTED NEW ERROR WHEN HE MADE IT BASIS HIS RECENT MESSAGE
TO AL.
6. FIGHTING AT TELL ZAATAR IS VIRTUALLY OVER WITH FINAL REDOUBT
TAKEN AND ONLY POCKETS OF RESISTANCE REMAINING. WE UNDERSTAND
THAT MAJORITY REMAINING DEFENDERS HAVE SURRENDERED. RED
CROSS, ON REQUEST OF BOTH SIDES,
HAS UNDERTAKEN EVACUATION OF WOUNDED AND WE UNDERSTAND
SOME 200 PALESTINIAN WOUNDED BROUGHT OUT OF TELL ZAATAR AND
DELIVERED TO RED CROSS ON JULY 3 AND 4. PALESTINIANS CLAIM AL
DEPUTY SECGEN HASSAN KHOLI HAD ARRANGED WITH RED CROSS FOR
TRANSPORT OF PALESTINIAN PRISONERS TO MUSEUM SECTOR FROM WHERE
THEY CAN REACH SABRA QAMP, BUT RIGHTIST MUTE ON SUBJECT.
WESTERN EYEITNESS WHO TOOK CONSIDERABLE RISK OF CROSSING
"GREEN LINE" FROM RIGHTIST SIDE SAYS IT DOUBTFUL RIGHTISTS HAVE
SUFFERED MORE THAN 100 CASUALTIES IN ENTIRE TELL ZAATAR BATTLE.
(YESTERDAY AL REPRESENTATIVE, SABRI AL-KHOULI, WAS SHOT AT WHILE
CROSSING HERE.) EYEWITNESS SAYS CAMP TOTALLY SURROUNDED FOR LAST
FEW DAYS AND CHRISTIANS DID NOT NEED MAKE FINAL ASSAULT AS CAMP
COMPLETELY CUT OFF AND CHRISTIANS DOMINATED CAMP FROM TALAT EL MIR.
KATAEB LEADERSHIP SAYING IT PLANS CLEAN OUT NABAA NEXT, AND
MANY SHIITE INHABITANTS REPORTED LEAVING AREA. NABAA IS UNDER
CONTROL OF LEFTIST AND PALESTINIAN ELEMENTS, AND IS LAST
REMAINING NON-CHRISTIAN ENCLAVE IN EAST BEIRUT.
7. IN BEIRUT AREA, KATAEB SAYS INFILTRATION EFFORTS OF
"PALESTINIANS AND THEIR MERCENARIES" HAVE BEEN REPULSED ALONG
CENTER CITY CONFRONTATION LINE. ACHRAFIYYAH STILL UNDER
BOMBARDMENTS FROM NABAA AND FIREFIGHTS CONTINUE ALONG
BECHARA EL-KHOURY AXIS. VILLENT FIGHTING CONTINUES IN ALEY
DISTRICT ON THE ROAD TO ARAY AND KAHALE. LEFTIST CLAIM TO
HAVE TAKEN VILLAGE OF ARAYA IS APPARENTLY FALSE. VILLAGE OF
BSOUSS AND KAHALE ALSO INVOLVED IN FIGHTING. CONTRARY TO
PREVIOUS REPORTS, HUGE FIRE OF NIGHT JULY 3 AND 4 WAS NOT AT
TELL ZAATAR BUT WAS BURNING OF WOODS AROUND ARAYA. VOICE OF
PALESTININE ANNOUCNES ANOTHER LARGE FOREST FIRE NEAR JDAIDE
FOLLOWING PALESTINIAN BOMBARDMENT OF SABTIE.
8. ELSEWHERE, LEFTIST SOURCES CLAIM SYRIAN ARMY ATTACKED
JOINT PALESTINIAN/LEFTIST GROUPS JULY 4 IN BEKAA. LEFTISTS
MAKE UNSUBSTANTIATED AND PROBABLY FALSE CLAIM THEY HAVE
DESTROYED SYRIAN ARMY HEADQUARTERS AT RAYAK. SYRIAN
BLOCKADES OF BAALBECK AND HERMEL CONTINUE. BOMBARDMENTS
CONTINUE BUT THERE IS NO GROUND ACTION IN NORTH METN OR AT
OUYOUN EL SIMANE. IN NORTH LEBANON, MUTUAL BOMBARDMENTS
CONTINUE BETWEEN TRIPOI AND ZGHORTA AND SOME FIGHTING
CONTINUES IN KOURA DISTRICT. DATE REORT OF BATTLE AT CHEKKA, OTED
ABOVE, INDICATES NORTH MAY BECOME CENTER OF STRIFE IN COMING DAYS.
9. SAEB SALAM FOLLOWED UP JULY 3 STATEMENT BY FATAH NO. 2
SALAH KHALAF ON ISRAELI MILITARY SUPPORT TO RIGHTISTS. SALAM
SAID NOT ONLY HAVE ISRAELIS SENT 40 TANKS TO JOUNIEH, BUT
NATIONAL LIBERAL PARTY AND ITS ALLIES HAVE ON SVERAL OCCASIONS
RECEIVED ARMS AND FUNDS FROM ISRAEL VIA CERTAIN LEBANOESE
AMBASSADORS IN EUROPE. AMIN GEMAYEL ALSO REACTED TO KHALAF
STATEMENT, SAYING IT IS "LIE" THAT HE ONCE TOLD KHALAF THAT
WHERAS HE HAD REFUSED ISRAELI MILITARY AID, CAMILLE CHAMOUN
HAD ACCEPTED IT. FOREIGNER WHO VISITED RIGHTIST HELD AREAS
SAYS CHRISTIAN FIGHTERS MAKING NO BONES ABOUT CARRYING
ISRAELI-SUPPLIED WEAPONS THOUGH SOME
WEAPONS HAVE SERIAL NUMBERS FILED OFF.

 * 23583 1976BEIRUT05822 0.007086108 | 1976-07-03 | BEIRUT | STATE | TALK WITH JUMBLATT JULY 1 SUMMARY: JUMBLATT SPOKE FOR ALMOST 2 HOURS  WITH ME ON WIDE
SUMMARY: JUMBLATT SPOKE FOR ALMOST 2 HOURS WITH ME ON WIDE
RANGE OF SUBJECTS. HE OUTLINED THE "SINS" OF THE CHRISTIANS AND
THE NEED TO REALIZE HOW MUCH THEY HAD TO LOSE IN SPECIFIC TERMS
FROM THEIR CURRENT ALLIANCE WITH THE SYRIANS.  HE ATTACKED
SYRIAN POLICY AND THOUGHT THE FIRST STEP IS THAT SYRIANS GET OUT
BEFORE A ROUND TABLE DISCUSSION CAN PROCEED.  HE WAS
GENERALLY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT CHANCES OF ENDING THE FIGHTING IN THE
NEAR FUTURE (THOUGH GIVING NO SPECIFIC EVIDENCE OF THIS BEYOND
THE GENERAL FEELING THAT "PEOPLE NEED A REST"), AND SAID TIME HAD
COME FOR COMPROMISE. HOWEVER, ROUND TABLE DISCUSSIONS MUST
BE CAREFULLY PREPARED, AND GAVE AS AN EXAMPLE TALKS HE AND THE
PALESTINIANS HAVE HAD WITH BASHIR GEMAYEL, SON OF PIERRE
GEMAYEL. HE OUTLINED SOME REFORMS, INCLUDING PROPORTIONAL
REPRESENTATION AND DE-CONFESSIONALIZATION OF THE STATE, AS
EXAMPLES OVER WHICH COMPROMISE CAN BE REACHED. THOUGH
RESTED AND SPEAKING IN REASONABLE TERMS, HE WAS NOT VERY
CONVINCING THAT PEACE IS AROUND THE CORNER.  END SUMMARY.
1.  I TOOK LAMBRADIS WITH ME TO CALL ON JUMBLATT JULY 1.  HE
LOOKED RESTED AFTER SOMETIME IN HIS MOUNTAIN RETREAT, WHERE
HE WAS NOT VERY INVOLVED WITH CURRENT POLITICS OVER THE PAST
WEEK OR SO.  HE WAS WELL-DRESSED, HAD A NEAT HAIRCUT, AND
GENERALLY PRESENTED A VERY RELAXED IMAGE AS HE OFFERED US
FRUIT AND DEVOURED IT HIMSELF, AS IS HIS AFTERNOON HABIT.
2.  NOTING THAT HE HAD NEVER MET AMBASSADOR MELOY
PERSONALLY, HE BEGAN WITH EXPRESSIONS OF PERSONAL SORROW AT
THE DEATH OF ROBERT WARING.  HE HAD CONSIDERED HIM AN
HONEST FRIEND AND HAD NOTED THINGS HE HAD DISCUSSED WITH
WARING WERE LISTENED TO IN WASHINGTON, SINCE HE HAD SEEN
PLAYBACKS OF THEM A FEW DAYS LATER IN PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS
OR PRESS REPORTS.  WHEN ASKED FOR HIS CURRENT BEST
ESTIMATE OF WHO THE MURDERERS WERE, JUMBLATT SAID HE
THOUGHT THE MURDERS HAD BEEN ORDERED BY DR. HADDAD, WHO
IS GEORGE HABASH'S DEPUTY IN THE PFLP.  HE SAID HE HAD
NOT BEEN IN TOUCH MORE RECENTLY WITH SPECIFICS OF THE
INVESTIGATION, BUT WOULD LOOK INTO IT FOR US.  I PRESSED HIM
ON THIS SCORE, AND HE SEEMED COMPLETELY WILLING TO DO WHAT
HE COULD.  HE NOTED HIS OWN SISTER'S DEATH AND THE WOUNDING
OF HIS NIECES.  SUCH PERSONAL GRIEF HELPS ONE APPRECIATE
THE GRIEF OF OTHERS, HE SAID.
3.  I EXPLAINED MY MISSION TO THE LEBANON, AND NOTED THAT IN
EARLIER CONVERSATIONS SINCE MY ARRIVAL CERTAIN SUGGESTIONS HAD
COME UP ON WHICH I HAD CONSISTENTLY TRIED TO SET THE RECORD
STRAIGHT.  I HAVE BEEN POINTING OUT THAT THE US IS AGAINST
LEBANESE PARTITION.  I HAVE MADE A POINT OF MENTIONING UNITY
OF LEBANON IN MY PUBLIC UTTERANCES.  I ALSO HAVE TRIED TO DEBUNK
LIES SUGGESTING THERE IS A SYRIAN-ISRAELI-CHRISTIAN-USG
CONSPIRACY TO SUPPRESS THE PALESTINIAN AND THE LEFT IN LEBANON.
I NOTED THAT THE PRESS AND RADIO NEVERTHELESS CONTINUED TO INSIST
ON THIS THEME DESPITE ANYTHING THE USG OR I CAN SAY.  JUMBLATT
NODDED HIS UNDERSTANDING.
4.  JUMBLATT ADVERTED INDIRECTLY TO US-SYRIAN COLLUSION.  HE
SAID HE BELIEVED US WHEN WE SAY WE ARE AGAINST PARTITION.
HOWEVER, US USED TO BE VERY STRICT ON QUESTION OF THE
INDEPENDENCE OF LEBANON.  THIS CAME UP IN 1958 EVEN IN
CONNECTION WITH US FACILITATING THE ELECTION OF GENERAL CHEHAB.
ISRAEL HAD BEEN WELL AWARE OVER THE YEARS OF US SUPPORT FOR
LEBANESE INDEPENDENCE.  HOWEVER, THERE HAVE BEEN SOME
CURIOUS EVENTS RECENTLY IN SYRIA.  ASSAD HAS "TURNED COSSACK"
AGAINST THE SOVIETS.  HE HAS RENEWED UNDOF MANDATE ON
GOLAN HEIGHTS WITHOUT ANY FUSS.  ONE CANNOT ESCAPE THE
CONCLUSION THAT US PERMISSION HAS BEEN GIVEN TO SYRIANS TOH
TO VERY FAR INDEED.  EVERYONE BELIEVES THIS, AND JUMBLATT
HAD TOLD THIS TO AMBASSADOR BROWNN WHO HE SAID OF COURSE
DENIED IT.  ONE CANNOT IMAGINE THE SYRIANS WOULD DARE ALLOW
THEIR TROOPS TO ENTER LEBANON WITHOUT SOME KIND OF US
GO-AHEAD. THIS IS A "PLOT" OF WHICH EDDE HAS BEEN TALKING
FOR A YEAR AND A HALF.
6.  JUMBLATT SAID HE BELIEVED SECRETARY KISSINGER HAS A
METHOD WHICH JUMBALTT ADMIRES IN ITS TACTICAL EFFICACY.  IT LETS
PEOPLE FIGHT EACH OTHER UNTIL THEY ARE TIRED AND THEN KISSINGER
STEPS IN WITH A SOLUTION.  BUT US SHOULD BE CAREFUL NOT TO LOSE
ITS FRIENDS IN THE LEBANON.  A SOCIALIST STATE MIGHT RISE IN THE
LEBANON OVER THE NEXT 2 TO 4 YEARS. (IN REPLY TO MY QUESTION,
JUMBLATT INSISTED HE WAS SPEAKING ABOUT A SOCIALIST STATE, NOT
A COMMUNIST.)
7.  SOCIAL REFORM HAD BECOME NECESSARY TO COUNTER MARONITE
PRIVILEGE, WHICH IS EXERCISED IN TERMS REMINISCENT OF THE
MIDDLE AGES.  FIVE PROPRIETORS OWN MOST OF THE BEKAA.  THERE
ARE UNCULTIVATED LANDS GOING TO WASTE WHILE HUNDREDS AND
THOUSANDS ARE MISERABLE IN THEIR POVERTY.  THE COUNTRY NEEDS
TRUE DEMOCRACY.  PROGRESSIVE FORCES WHICH JUMBLATT LEADS
BELIEVE IN LIBERTY.  THEY DO NOT BELIEVE IN COMMUNISM, NOR
CLASS WARFARE, OR IN COUPS D'ETAT.  HE CLAIMED ALONG THAT
LINE TO HAVE PREVENTED GENERAL AHDAB FROM MARCHING AGAINST
FRANGIE WHEN FRANGIE DID NOT RESIGN IN MARCH.  THIS WAS NOT
THE DEMOCRATIC WAY, JUMBLATT SAID.  (AS WE RECALL IT,
JUMBLATT'S GROUP MAY HAVE HAD A PART IN THIS, BUT IT IS FAR
FROM CLEAR THAT HE ALONE PREVENTED AHDAB FROM MARCHING.)
8.  THE MARONITES MUST UNDERSTAND THAT OPPOSITION TO THEM CAN
CONTINUE FOR YEARS IF THEY DO NOT YIELD.  JUMBLATT IS PREPARED
TO DISCUSS THINGS OVER THE ROUND TABLE, BUT NOT TO CONTINUE
ACCEPTING MARONITE MASTERY OF THE COUNTRY.  MARONITES HAVE
SEVERAL SPECIFIC THINGS THEY SHOULD THINK ABOUT: FIRST, IT IS
NOT CLEAR HOW FAR COMMUNISTS MIGHT GO IN LEBANON.
JUMBLATT SAID HE DID NOT LIKE THE COMMUNISTS HIMSELF (AND IN
FACT EXPECTS GREATER DEMOCRATIZATION IN THE SOVIET UNION BY
ABOUT 1985).  HOWEVER, MARONITES SHOULD FEAR COMMUNIST
TREND IN LEBANON IF CONDITIONS ON WHICH THEY BREED ARE NOT
CHANGED.  SECOND, MARONITES SHOULD FEAR EMIGRATION OF THEIR
OWN PEOPLE IF THEY MAINTAIN CURRENT SEPARATENESS BEHIND
THEIR GUNS.  JUMBLATT WAS TOLD 80 PERCENT OF DOCTORS HAVE
ALREADY FLED THE COUNTRY.  THESE STUBBORN
MARONITES MAY SOME DAY FIND THEIR NUMBERS
SO REDUCED THAT THEY WILL BE FACED BY A CRUSHING
MAJORITY OF ISLAM.  THIRD, MARONITES SHOULD FEAR SYRIA.
SOME SUCH AS BASHIR GEMAYEL WISELY OPPOSED SYRIAN
INTERVENTION FOR THIS REASON; OTHERS -- PARTICULARLY THE
MONKS AND CLERICS OF THE CATHOLIC FRONT -- MAINTAIN THEIR
HOPES FOR A NEW CRUSADE.  SYRIANS BELIEVE THEY HAVE A CHANCE
TO REPLACE MOTHER FRANCE AS PROTECTOR OF LEBANON, AND IN
PARTICULAR THE MARONITES.  BUT ONE DAY THERE COULD BE A CHANGE
OF REGIME IN SYRIA WITH SUNNIS OVERTHROWING THE REGIME AND
LIVING UP THEIR FORCES IN LEBANON WITH THE LEFT.  TOP
CHRISTIAN LEADERS SHOULD REALIZE THIS.  (COMMENTING
SPECIFICALLY ON GEMAYEL, JUMBLATT SAID HE SUFFERED FROM
HALLUCINATIONS AND HAD NO INTELLECTUAL BAGGAGE.  CLINICALLY HIS
FATHER HAD SUFFERED FROM HALLUCINATIONS.)
9.  FINALLY, CHRISTIANS SHOULD REALIZE FORTUNE THEY MADE IN
THE PAST WAS BASED ON EXPLOITATION OF ARAB OIL AND SERVICES TO
OTHER ARAB COUNTRIES.  MARONITES HAVE LOST MUCH OF THIS
MONEY (HE SPOKE OF 50,000 LEBANESE IN FRANCE, MANY OF
THEM IN FINANCIAL NEED AT PRESENT).  MARONITES MUST REALIZE
THAT THESE ARAB STATES WILL TURN AGAINST EHEM AND ISOLATE
THEM IF THEY CONTINUE TO BEHAVE AS THEY DO.  JUMBLATT
HIMSELF HAD TO INTERVENE SOME MONTHS AGO FOR FRIENDS WHO WERE
ABOUT TO BE EXPELLED FROM LIBYA AND KUWAIT.

10.  TROUBLE WITH MARONITES, JUMBLATT SUMMED UP, IS THAT THEY
ARE OBSESSED BY FEAR.  SARKIS MAY TURN OUT TO BE THE LAST
MARONITE PRESIDENT OF LEBANON.  THEY MADE A BIG MISTAKE IN
CURRENT ATTACK ON TELL ZAATAR, WHICH HE WAS SORRY TO SEE
BASHIR GEMAYEL ALSO JOINED IN ON FINALLY.  MUSLIMS COULD HAVE
DONE NASTY THINGS TO CHRISTIAN VILLAGES SUCH AS DEIR EL-QAMAR
(IN THE CHOUF), BUT THEY WOULD NOT.  NOR WOULD MUSLIMS ATTACK
CHRISTIANS IN RAS BEIRUT, AS MANY SEEMED TO FEAR.  MARONITES
MUST HAVE CONFIDENCE IN DEMOCRACY AND ACCEPT WESTERNIZING
THE COUNTRY INSTITUTIONS.  BY THIS HE MEANT REFORMS TO SUPPRESS
SECTARIANISM AND ESTABLISH GOVERNMENT ON MODERN PRINCIPLES.
11.  I ASKED HIM IF HE HAD NOT ACCEPTED THE COMPROMISE AGREEMENT
ANNOUNCED LAST FEBRUARY BY FRANGIE.  JUMBLATT SAID THOSE POINTS
HAD BEEN ACCEPTABLE THEN, BUT CHRISTIANS HAD REJECTED THEM, AND
SITUATION HAS CHANGED.  THE LEFT ALLIANCES PARTIES WILL NO LONGER
ACCEPT THEM.  IN THIS SENSE MARONITES ARE ARABS, AND HAVE BEEN
ACTING AS ARABS HAVE ACTED HISTORICALLY TOWARDS ISRAEL --
THEY ACCEPT NOTHING UNTIL IT IS TOO LATE.
12.  COURSE AHEAD, JUMBLATT SAID, MUST BE TO PREPARE A
COMPROMISE AGREEMENT.  THIS MUST BE PRECEDED BY NEGOTIATIONS
THROUGH QUIET OR PUBLIC CONTACTS BETWEEN THE SIDES, BEFORE FINAL
AGREEMENT IS BROUGHT TO A ROUND TABLE AND SANCTIONED THERE.
THEN THERE SHOULD BE A NEW PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION ACCORDING
TO THE NEW PRINCIPLES AGREED UPON.  WHEN ASKED TO SPECIFY
REFORMS HE WANTED, HE MENTIONED PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION
IN PARLIAMENT WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF GETTING MORE YOUNG PEOPLE
IN.  HOWEVER, THIS SHOULD BE LIMITED TO NO MORE THAN THREE
PARTIES BEING ELECTED, AND LIST SHOULD PERMIT VOTERS TO EXPRESS
INDIVIDUAL PREFERENCES FOR PEOPLE ON THE LIST.  A SECOND CHAMBER
SHOULD BE CREATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS WELL-PUBLICIZED
PROGRAM.  OBJECTIVE IS TO ABOLISH CONFESSIONALISM AND
ELEIMINATE MEDIOCRITY IN PARLIAMENT.  I ASKED IF HE MEANT
ELIMINATING FEUDAL REMNANTS.  NO, JUMBLATT INSISTED, HE MEANT
ELIMINATING MEDIOCRITY. (COMMENT: JUMBLATT OF COURSE
DERIVES HIS MOST STEADY SUPPORT FROM HIS TRADITIONAL FEUDAL
SUZERAINTY OVER MUCH OF THE DRUZE COMMUNITY).
13.  PHALANGE (PROBABLY BASHIR GEMAYEL) HAS ACCEPTED
PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION, JUMBLATT ASSERTED, BUT NOT
AN END TO CONFESSIONALISM.  JUMBLATT THOUGH PARTIES OF THE
LEFT CAN IMPOSE ON OTHER, MORE CONSERVATIVE MUSLIMS A REFORM
PROGRAM WHICH WOULD, FOR EXAMPLE, PERMIT CIVIL MARRIAGE AND
SIMILAR CHANGES WHICH MANY CHRISTIANS SUPPORT.  YOUNG
PEOPLE, BOTH CHRISTIAN AND MUSLIM, ARE IDEALISTIC.  THEY WILL
INSIST ON TOUGH REFORMS.  THERE IS LITTLE DIFFERNENCE BETWEEN
THESE YOUNG PEOPLE, EXCEPT THAT THE CHRISTIAN YOUTH DO NOT
UNDERSTAND THE PALESTINIANS AND HOW TO HANDLE THEM.
MEANWHILE, COMPETITION AMONG TRADITIONAL CHRISTIAN LEADDERS
SUCH AS CHAMOUN AND GEMAYEL LENDS TO ESCALATION OF RHETORIC
AND MILITARY ACTION FOR NO GOOD REASON.  THIS SHOULD END.
14.  AS TO PALESTINIANS, ELIMINATION OF SAIQA HAS BEEN A GOOD
THING.  OF COURSE SOME GROUPS SUCH AS PFLP RESORT
INOPPORTUNELY TO TERRORISM (HERE JUMBLATT SHOWED HE DID
NOT APPROVE RECENT AIR FRANCE HIJACKING).  THERE ARE ALSO
TROUBLE-MAKING SMALL GROUPS BACKED BY LIBYANS AND IRAQIS
AS WELL AS SYRIANS.  HOWEVER, WITH SAIQA DISAPPEARANCE,
PALESTINIANS CAN NOW IMPOSE THEIR OWN LAW AMONG MOST OF
THEIR PEOPLE.  LEBANESE MUST LEARN HOW TO DEAL WITH
PALESTINIANS, OFFER THEM A BETTER LIFE.  THIS IS AN IMPORTANT
PEOPLE NUMBERING THREE MILLION THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.  THEY DO
NOT WANT TO LIVE HERE ONLY AS AN ARMY.  IN THIS SENSE, JUMBLATT
SAID HE HAD NO FEAR FOR THE FUTURE OF THE COUNTRY.  PEOPLE MAY
EVEN HAVE BENEFITED FROM THEIR EXORCISM OF BLOOD....
15.  SPECIFICALLY, JUMBLATT SAID, 1969 DAIRO ACCORD IS OUT OF
DATE,  BUT MODUS VIVENDI CAN BE REACHED WITH PALESTINIANS.  HE
NOTED THAT PALESTINIANS REMAIN IN TOUCH WITH CHRISTIANS THROUGH
ABU HASSAN WHO GOES BACK AND FORTH ACROSS THE DIVIDING LINE,
AS DOES PHALANGE'S BAYIR GEMAYEL.  HE THEN MADE SOME
REMARKS ABOUT A VIABLE PALESTINIAN STATE TO INCLUDE JORDAN,
AND THE 1,200,000 PALESTINIANS HAVING A COANCE TO RETURN TO
THEIR HOMES IN HAIFA, ETC. ETC. (JUMBLATT IS CLEARLY BEYOND
HIS DEPTH OR INTEREST WHEN HE STARTS TALKING ABOUT THE LARGER
PALESTINIAN PROBLEM).
16.  SPECIFICALLY ON SYRIANS, JUMBLATT SAID THAT THEY MUST LEAVE
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  ALL MUSLIMS ARE AGAINST THEM.  ASSAD IS
A MEDIOCRE MAN WHO HAS REPEATEDLY REFUSED TO TAKE
OPPORTUNITIES TO GET OUT OF THE LEBANON.  AS TO REASONS FOR
SYRIAN INTERVENTION, JUMBLATT SPECULATED, SOME SAY SYRIA
WANTS THE BEKAA.  OTHERS SAY SYRIA WISHES TO REPLACE FRANCE
AND HAS TAKEN THIS HISTORIC OPPORTUNITY TO GET CLOSE TO THE
MARONITES.  JUMBLATT CLAIMED ASSAD HAS SPECIFICALLY
TOLD HIM THIS ON FREQUENT OCCASIONS WHILE THEY WERE STILL IN
CONTACT, AS OF A FEW MONTHS AGO.  ALSO, ASSAD HOPED TO WIN
A CARD IN HIS DIPLOMATIC GAME, GOING TO FRANCE AS A FRIEND OF
JORDAN ON THE ONE HAND AND WITH CONTROL OVER LEBANON AND THE
PALESTINIANS ON THE OTHER.  THIS WOULD HAVE HELPED HIM IN US
EYES TOO AND MAYBE HELPED GET A GOLAN SETTLEMENT OF THE KIND
HE WANTS.  HOWEVER, EGYPT IS NOW BEGINNING TO REPLACE
SYRIA IN THE LEBANON AS IS NORMAL.  AT LEAST SADAT IN HIS
SINAI II POLICY WAS FRANK.  HE HAS WON MUCH RESPECT.
17.  JUMBLATT TENDED TO DOWN-PLAY THE PROBLEM OF SECURITY
IN LEBANON.  HE SAID THE VARIOUS PARTIES ARE BEGINNING TO TAKE
SECURITY IN HAND.  THERE ARE FEWER ASSASSINATIONS NOW AND LOOTING
IS LESS BOTH IN BEIRUT AND IN THE MOUNTAINS.  THE LEBANESE
ARMY WILL BE REBUILT.  THE POPULACE, ONCE IT HAS PEACE, WILL
SELL ITS ARMS.  WITH $20 MILLION, JUMBLATT SAID, THE STATE
COULD BUY BACK THE ARMS ITSELF.  PEOPLE ARE HUNGRY.  AGAIN
HE RETURNED TO HIS THEME THAT YOUNG PEOPLE MUST BE ALLOWED
TO TAKE POWER IN THIS COUNTRY.
18.  FINALLY, JUMBLATT WISHED ME WELL.  HE SAID DEAN BROWN
DID A GOOD JOB HERE.  HE PERHAPS LACKED PATIENCE.  IT IS
BETTER TOWORK A LITTLE MORE SLOWLY AND PATIENTLY AND PERHAPS
WITH LOWER PROFILE, BUT US CAN BE HELPFUL.
19.  SUMMING UP HIS VIEWS, JUMBLATT SAID HE EXPECTED THE
WAR TO END SOON.  EVEN THOUGH HE ADMITTED HIS OWN AIMS ARE
WHAT AMOUNT TO A CONTINUOUS REVOLUTION UNTIL POWER MOVES
FROM THE HANDS OF THE MARONITES TO HIS OWN AND THOSE OF
OTHERS ALLIED WITH HIM, HE THOUGHT MEDITERRANEAN PEOPLE
SUCH AS THE LEBANESE AND PALESTINIANS NEED A REST.  TIME
HAS COME FOR COMPROMISE, AND HE IS PREPARED FOR THAT.
WHEN I ASKED WHETHER CONCENTRATED BITTERNESS BETWEEN
FACTIONS MIGHT NOT IMPEDE COMPROMISE, HE SAID PEOPLE
TEND TO FORGET THE CARNAGE, BLOOD, AND DESTRUCTION,
PARTICULARLY IF A CATASTROPHE IS BIG ENOUGHT.  MEANWHILE
NOTHING CAN BE DONE BY WAY OF FORMAL PEACEMAKING UNTIL
THE SYRIANS WITHDRAW TOTALLY FROM THE LEBANON.
20.  COMMENT:  AS I HAVE BEEN TOLD TO EXPECT, JUMBLATT
HAS AN UNCANNILY WINNING PERSONALITY.  IT IS HARD TO DISLIKE THE
MAN FACE TO FACE.  HE HAS MANY MOODS AND MANY GUISES AND
SEEMS TO BE SPEAKING FRANKLY AT ALL TIMES.  HOWEVER, WHAT HE
SAID OFTEN STRUCK ME AS UNREALISTIC TO SAY THE LEAST.  IN
PARTICULAR, I WAS STRUCK BY HIS GREAT OPTIMISM TO ME IN VIEW
OF HIS SIMULTANEOUS PUBLIC PRONOUNCEMENTS THAT THE WAR WILL
CONTINUE AND VIETNAMIZATION MAY RESULT IF THE CHRISTIANS DO NOT
STOP THEIR ATTACK ON TELL XAATAR.  HE IS CLEARLY A MAN WHOSE
WORDS SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN AT FACE VALUE.  BUT HE IS ALSO A
LEADER WHO SEEMS INDISPENSIBLE IN THE CURRENT POLITICAL
MAKEUP HERE.  HE IS OUT TO BECOME NUMBER ONE IN THE LEBANON,
EVEN IF THIS TAKES A FEW MORE YEARS.

** 91062 1976JIDDA04709 0.007086047 | 1976-07-05 | JIDDA | STATE | PRINCE FAHD'S VIEWS ON ARAB/ISRAELI SETTLEMENT
1.  PRIOR TO PROVIDING PRINCE FAHD WITH YOUR VIEWS ON
PROBLEMS OF MOVING TOWARD GENERAL SETTLEMENT OF ISRAELI-ARAB
ISSUES AS THEY EMERGED IN PARIS MEETING, I BELIEVED HE WAS
OF OPINION THAT SUCH AN EFFORT SHOULD NOT BE ATTEMPTED UNTIL
AFTER ELECTIONS.  HE CORRECTED MY IMPRESSION, SAYING THAT HE
AGREED THAT NOTHING WOULD BE PRACTICAL UNTIL REPUBLICANS
NOMINATE THEIR CANDIDATE FOR THE PRESIDENCY, BUT HE HOLDS THAT
USG CAN AND SHOULD IMMEDIATELY AFTER THAT EVENT MOUNT AN
EFFORT TO NEGOTIATE A GENERAL SETTLEMENT AND SHOULD PROVIDE ITS
OWN VIEWS AS TO WHAT THAT MIGHT INCLUDE.  FAHD BELIEVES THAT
ALL PRINCIPAL FACTORS, MEANING ISRAELI, ARAB, U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL
OPINION ARE READY FOR SUCH AN EFFORT AND THAT TO AWAIT THE
OUTCOME OF THE U.S. ELECTIONS WOULD DIMINISH RATHER THAN
ENHANCE THE PROSPECTS FOR SUCCESS.
2.  HE ADDS THAT THE AMERICAN PUBLIC, WHICH IS THE MOST
IMPORTANT ELEMENT IN THE EQUATION, IS NOW SUFFICIENTLY EDUCATED
ABOUT ARAB-ISRAELI ISSUES, AND IS AWARE THAT LOGIC AND JUSTICE
ARE NOT ALL ON ONE SIDE.  AMERICANS ARE AWARE THAT OUR
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE EXISTENCE AND SECURITY OF THE STATE OF
ISRAEL IS CLEAR AND THAT WE CANNOT DIVEST OURSELVES OF THAT
RESPONSIBILITY.  AT SAME TIME HE BELIEVES THE AMERICAN PUBLIC
IS MORE THAN TIRED OF POLITICAL ISOLATION, THE EXPENSE AND THE
MANEUVERING WHICH HAVE KEPT THE PROBLEM IN THE FOREFRONT OF
AMERICAN DOMESTIC POLITICS FOR SO LONG.
3.  FAHD SAID THESE THINGS TO ME AND MORE.  HIS HOPE THAT
PRESIDENT FORD'S CAMPAIGN WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL WAS CLEARLY
EXPRESSED AND, ONCE THE NOMINATING PROCESS ENDS, HE SEES THE
INTERIM BETWEEN IT AND ELECTION DAY AS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR
ACTION RATHER THAN STAGNATION.  AMERICANS ADMIRE THE PRESIDENT'S
POLITICAL COURAGE, HE DECLARED, AND WOULD ADMIRE HIM MORE FOR
ACTION DESIGNED TO SETTLE THE PROBLEM.  HE WOULD NOT LISTEN TO
MY COMMENT THAN AN ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE CHARACTER HE HAD IN
MIND MIGHT EMBITTER THE CAMPAIGN.  THE CAMPAIGN HAD ALREADY
DEMONSTRATED THAT ZIONIST SUPPORT COULD NOT ACHIEVE A GREAT DEAL
FOR THOSE CANDIDATES WHO HAD IT, HE DECLARED.
4.  AS FOR LEBANON, HE APPRECIATED HEARING AGAIN THAT WE DO
NOT FAVOR PARTITION.  HE ADDED THAT WOULD NOT EVEN BE IN THE
INTEREST OF THE IERAELIS, THOUGH THEY MIGHT THINK IT IS.  HE
OBVIOUSLY FEARS THE DISINTEGRATING AND GENERALLY DANGEROUS EFFECT
OF THE PLO PRESENCE IN LEBANON AND SAID THAT RECENT EVENTS HAD
MADE THE NECESSITY OF GETTING THEM BACK INTO THEIR HOMELAND,
THE WEST BANK, EVEN CLEARER.
5.  RETURNING TO THE SUBJECT OF A GENERAL SETTLEMENT OF THE ARAB-
ISRAELI PROBLEM, HE INSISTED THAT AN AMERICAN EFFORT TO ACHIEVE
"PEACE AND TRANQUILITY IN RETURN FOR ARAB TERRITORIES TAKEN OVER
BY ISRAEL IN 1967" WOULD EVOKE WIDESPREAD ARAB, ISLAMIC AND
INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT.

(C) MAPUTO 746 (NOTAL)
1. AT RECEPTION HOSTED BY PRESIDENT AMIN FOLLOWING OAU SUMMIT
OPENING SESSION EVENING JULY 2 I APPROACHED WALDHEIM AND HAD BRIEF
EXCHANGE WITH HIM RE ENTEBBE HIJACKING SITUATION. HE SAID: "PLEASE
TELL YOUR SECRETARY OF STATE THAT I AM DOING ALL IN MY POWER TO BE
HELPFUL." HE HAD HAD NO DIRECT NEWS SINCE DEPARTING MAPUTO EARLIER
IN DAY. WALDHEIM SAID HE HAD HAD A BRIEF CONVERSATION WITH AMIN
PRIOR TO OAU SUMMIT OPENING SESSION AND THEY HAD SCHEDULED ANOTHER
MEETING FOR THIS MORNING (10 A.M. LOCAL JULY 3). WALDHEIM
REMARKED THAT AMIN "LIKES TO RUN THE WHOLE SHOW," SO IT IS
DIFFICULT TO GET HIM TO DO WHAT ONE WANTS. WALDHEIM THOUGHT
THERE WAS SOME ADVANTAGE IN THE FACT THAT THE UNDP REP IN
KAMPALA WHOM HE HAD INSTRUCTED TO GET INVOLVED IS AN AFRICAN
(GHANAIAN). HE ALSO REMARKED THAT AMIN HAD SAID HE WANTED THE
ISRAELIS TO COME TO KAMPALA TO NEGOTIATE.
2. NEITHER AMIN NOR WALDHEIM ATTENDED A MAURITIAN CEREMONY WHICH
PRECEDED FIRST WORKING SESSION OF OAU SUMMIT MORNING OF JULY 3.
3. ALSO HAD A BRIEF ENCOUNTER WITH AMIN AT HIS RECEPTION. EXCHANGE
WAS FRIENDLY, REMARKABLY SO CONSIDERING THAT AT OUR LAST MEETING
IN KAMPALA IN OCTOBER 1973 HE THREATENED TO ARREST ALL AMERICANS
IN UGANDA STARTING WITH ME IF U.S. INTERVENED ON SIDE OF ISRAEL
IN WAR THEN UNDERWAY IN MIDDLE EAST. AMIN INVITED ME TO KAMPALA
AND SAID HE NOW HAS FIFTY AMERICANS IN UGANDA ADVISING HIS AIR
FORCE. A MEMBER OF HIS ENTOURAGE (BYAGAGAIRE) LATER CORRECTED
THIS TO ABOUT FIVE AMERICANS PROVIDING TECHNICAL HELP
AND SERVING AS PILOTS FOR THEIR NEW INTERNAL AIRLINE,
AIR UGANDA.
4. AMIN DISCUSSED HIJACKING IN COURSE OF HIS EXTEMPORANEOUS
REMARKS AT OAU OPENING. IN A BOASTFUL FASHION, HE MADE
FOLLOWING POINTS: (A) ALTHOUGH HE HAD NOT INVITED HIJACKERS
TO UGANDA, HE HAD PERMITTED PLANE TO LAND FOR HUMANITARIAN
REASONS; (B) FACT THAT EUROPEANS WERE AMONG HIJACKERS SHOWED
THAT PALESTINIANS ENJOY WORLD-WIDE SUPPORT; (C) FOR FIRST TIME
IN HISTORY HOSTAGES HAVE BEEN PERMITTED TO LEAVE PLANE AND
SEEK COMFORT IN AIRPORT TRANSIT LOUNGE; (D) HE HAD WORKED
HARD TO GET AS MANY HOSTAGES RELEASED AS POSSIBLE;
(E) HE HAD COMPLIED WITH HIJACKERS' DEMANDS REGARDING
RELEASE OF ONLY PART OF HOSTAGE GROUP BECAUSE THEY
WERE "SURROUNDED" BY EXPLOSIVES AND WERE IN DANGER OF BEING
KILLED; (F) "SOME OF THE ISRAELI HOSTAGES ARE "INNOCENT", SO
THEY SHOULD NOT BE KILLED; (G) AS A RESULT OF THIS INCIDENT, HE
HAD RECEIVED SEVERAL PHONE CALLS FROM ISRAEL, FOR FIRST TIME
SINCE HE HAD BROKEN RELATIONS WITH ISRAEL IN 1972. AMIN
REMARKED THAT HE WOULD PROBABLY NOT BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE
FULLY IN OAU SUMMIT AS HE HAD A PROBLEM AT HOME THAT HE HAD
TO DEAL WITH. THIS HAS LED TO SPECULATION THAT AMIN WILL
RETURN TO KAMPALA, POSSIBLY TODAY, JULY 3, TO CONTINUE
DEALING WITH HIJACKERS. A MEMBER OF HIS DELEGATION (PAUL
ETIANG) TOLD ME LAST NIGHT THAT THIS WAS PROBABLE.

 * 309235 1976TELAV04701 0.007085381 | 1976-07-07 | TEL AVIV | STATE | CABINET AND KNESSET TO RECONSIDER DEATH PENALTY FOR TERRORISTS
TERRORISTS
SUMMARY: FOLLOWING THE ENTEBBE EPISODE, A NUMBER OF
MINISTERS AND KNESSET MEMBERS HAVE PROPOSED THAT THE
GOVERNMENT REVIEW ITS POLICY ON DEATH PENALTY FOR TERRORIST
KILLERS.  MINISTERYFREPORTEDLY ARE RELUCTANT TO HOLD A
FULL SCALE DEBATE ON THE SUBJECT UNDER THE IMMEDIATE IMPACT OF THE
ENTEBBE OPERATION, BUT IS EXPECTED THAT THE MATTER
WILL BE PLACED ON THE CABINET AGENDA WITHIN A FEW WEEKS.
END SUMMARY.
1.  ISRAELI LAW PROVIDES FOR CAPITAL PUNISHMENT BUT IT
HAS BEEN GOVERNMENT POLICY NOT TO APPLY IT IN PRACTICE.
JUSTICE MINISTER ZADOK, REVIEWING THE GOVERNMENT'S
POSITION IN JULY 6 KNESSET DEBATE, RECALLED THAT ON
OCTOBER 29, 1967, THE ESHKOL GOVERNMENT HAD INSTRUCTED
PROSECUTORS TO WITHOLD REQUESTS FOR EXECUTION OF
CONVICTED TERRORISTS.  THE RABIN GOVERNMENT REAFFIRMED
THIS POLICY ON AUGUST 4, 1974.  (INDEED, AS FAR AS THIS
EMBASSY KNOWS, THERE HAVE BEEN ONLY TWO CASES OF CAPITAL
EXECUTIONS IN ISRAEL'S HISTORY--THE FIRST WAS AN ISRAELI
CHARGED WITH TREASON DURING THE WAR OF INDEPENDENCE
AND POSTHUMOUSLY FOUND TO HAVE BEEN INNOCENT AND THE
SECOND WAS ADOLF EICHMAN IN 1962.)
2.  PRIME MINISTER RABIN REFERRED BRIEFLY TO THE NEED
FOR A POLICY REVIEW IN A JULY 5 MEETING OF THE LABOR
ALIGNMENT EXECUTIVE.  HE GAVE NO INDICATION, HOWEVER,
AS TO HIS OWN VIEWS ON THE MATTER.  DEFENSE MINISTER PERES
IN A SPEECH ON JULY 6 SAID THAT HIS PERSONAL VIEW WAS
THAT ISRAEL SHOULD REFRAIN FROM EXECUTINLRTERRORISTS
EXCEPT FOR UNUSUAL CASES SUCH AS THAT OF THE JAPANESE
TERRORIST KOZO OKAMOTO WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE 1972 LOD
AIRPORT MASSACRE.
3.  JUSTICE MINISTER HAIM ZADOK TOLD THE KNESSET THAT HE
WAS NOT IMPOSED TO THE DEATH PENALTY FOR TERRORISTS "ON
PRINCIPLE OR ON HUMANITARIAN GROUNDS..."HE ADDED THAT
"AS THINGS STAND NOW, SHYING AWAY FROM THE DEATH PENALTY FOR
TERRORISTS IS NOT A LAW BUT A MATTER OF GOVERNMENT
POLICY.  IT MAY BE ADVISABLE TO REVIEW THAT POLICY NOW, NOT
IN THE HEAT OF EMOTION, BUT IN A DVBUBERATE MANNER...
FOR ME, THE ONLY CONSIDERAT*, 8 , WILL IT (THE DEATH
PENALTY) AID IN OUR FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM?"
4.  JERUSALEM POST CORRESPONDENTS WALLFISH AND LANDAU
WRITE ON JULY 6 THAT THE CURRENT DEBATE IS A RESULT
OF THE REALIZATION "THAT THE TERROR GROUP RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE UGANDA HIJACK IS AN UNPRECEDENTEDLY SOPHISTICATED
AS
DETERMENED GANG OF INTERNATIONAL OUTLAWS--NOT ALL
PALESTINIANS--WHO ARE LIKELY TO TRY SIMILAR ACTIONS AGAIN...
THOSE WHO FAVOR A REVIEW OF THE DEATH PENALTY POLICY
ARGUE THAT THE PRESENCE IN ISRAEL OF SUCH 'SPECTACULAR'
KILLERS AS ILAMOTO SERVES AS A INNSTANT INCENTIVE AND
INCITEMENT FOR FURTHER HIJACK ATTEMPTS...AT THE SAME
TIME, HOWEVER, HUMANITARIAN AND MORAL CONSIDERATIONS
WHICH HAVE GUIDED ISRAEL AWAY FROM EVER IMPLEMENTING
THE DEATH
PENALTY STILL POWERDELLY AFFECT POLICYMAKERS."
5.  THE LIKUD EXECUTIVE JULY 5 UNANIMOUSLY VOTED IN
FAVOR OF APPLYING THE DEATH PENALTY FOR TERRORISTS AND
HAS DEMANDED AN URGENT KNESSET DEBATE ON THE SUBJECT.
6.  COMMENT: PUBLIC DEBATE OVER THE MERITS OF THE
DEATH PENALTY FOR TERRORISTS INEVITABLY SURFACES IN
THE WAKE OF MAJOR TERRORISTS OPERATIONS.  THE ISSUE
WAS VIGOROUSLY ARGUED AFTER DVE KIRYAT SHMONA AND MAALOT
MASSACURES IN THE SPRING OF 1974 WHICH INVOLVED THE
DEATH OF CHILDREN AND TEENAGERS.  IN THE PRESENT INSTANCE,
THERE IS AGAIN A GROUNDSWELL OF SENTIMENT IN FAVOR OF
REVERSING GOVERNMENT POLICY.   THE FINAL DECISION, HOWEVER,
WILL REST WITH RABIN WHO, ON THIS PARTICULAR
MATTER, IS LIKELY TO CONSULT CLOSELY WITH JUSTICE
MINISTER ZADOK.

COOLING BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES FOR SEVERAL MONTHS AND
MAURITIUS HAD NOT RESPONDED TO ISRAELI REQUESTS TO ACCREDIT
NEW ISRAELI AMBASSADOR. PRESS REPORTED THAT GOM ACTION OF
BREAKING RELATIONS HAD ALREADY BEEN TAKEN JULY 1 BEFORE THE
ISRAELI COMMANDO OPERATION IN UGANDA. HOWEVER, GOM HAS
NOT MADE PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT OF RUPTURE. END UNCLASSIFIED
2. COMMENT: MINEXTAFF PERMANENT SECRETARY TOLD EMBOFF
THAT PRIME MINISTER RAMGOOLAM HAD INSTRUCTED MAURITIAN
EMBASSY IN LONDON TO INFORM ISRAELIS OF GOM DECISION TO
TERMINATE DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS, APPARENTLY SOMETIME LAST
WEEK. GOM CONTINUED TO MAINTAIN DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH
ISRAEL AFTER OTHER AFRICAN STATES HAD SEVERED THEIR RELATIONS
LARGELY BECAUSE OF THE HIGH RESPECT RAMGOOLAM HAS FOR GOLDA
MEIR. RAM HAS COMMENTED THAT HE DOESN'T KNOW THE NEW
GENERATION OF LEADERS IN ISRAEL AND HE HAS NOTICEABLY
COOLED TOWARDS ISRAEL AS HIS FRIEND GOLDA MEIR LEFT ACTIVE
POLITICS. IN RECENT MONTHS, GOM HAS UNDERTAKEN TO
STRENGTHEN DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH THE ARAB WORLD. THE
NEW GOM ALIGNMENT WITH THE ARABS AND AFRICAN OAU PRESSURE
SEEM TO HAVE CONVINCED RAM THAT DIPLOMATIC TIES WITH ISRAEL
WERE A LUXURY HE COULD NO LONGER AFFORD. RAM MAY ALSO HOPE
THAT BREAKING RELATIONS WITH ISRAEL WILL HELP HOM WITH MOSLEM
VOTERS IN GENERAL ELECTIONS LATER THIS YEAR.

1. ALL KUWAIT DAILIES UNANIMOUS IN DENOUNCING ISRAELI RAID ON
AIRPORT IN UGANDA.  EDITORIALS IN MOST KUWAIT DAILIES CRITICAL
OF ISRAELS BUT REACTION ONE OF FRUSTRATION DUE TO SUCCESSFUL
PRE-EMPTIVE ATTACK.  THEREFORE ARABS FEELING MORTIFIED BUT
UNABLE COORDINATE RESPONSES.  EDITORIALS PRIMARILY ADOPT
WRINGING-OF-HANDS ATTITUDE.  "AL RAI AL AAM" DISCUSSES "MYTHICAL
FEAR SKILLFUL AND INGENIOUS...".  AL SIYASSAH COLUMNIST NOTES
FACTS ISRAEL SEEMS TO BE NATION "WHICH IS ALWAYS CAPABLE..."
AND DEPLORES "DECLARED INNOCENCE ARAB REGIME...".  ONLY AL
SIYASSAH, IN COLUMN BY MUSTAFA ABU LIBDEH, TOP POLITICAL/ECONOMIC
WRITER, IS QUESTION OF AMERICAN INVOLVEMENT RAISED.  LIBDEH
CALLS OPERATION ONE WHICH MEANT TO AVERT "ESCALATION OF FIGHTING
IN LEBANON...CONTRARY TO U.S. POLICY..."  "THEREFORE AN OPERATION

2. COMMENT: THE ISRAEL ENTEBBE OPERATION, COMING AS IT DOES ON
TOP OF SEVERAL QUASI-TERRORIST INCIDENTS IN KUWAIT (THE BOMBING
AT SYRIAN AIRLINES AND "AL-ANBA" NEWSPAPER), HAS ONLY UNDERSCORED
TENDER-BOX SECURITY SITUATION IN KUWAIT AND JITTERINESS AMONG
KUWAITI AUTHORITIES.  KUWAITS HAVE BEGUN TO INSTITUTE LATE-
NIGHT RANDON ROAD CHECKPOINT SEARCHES, SOMETHING UNHEARD OF
IN RECENT TIMES, IN AN EFFORT TO CHECKMATE MOVES BY POTENTIAL
TROUBLE-MAKERS.  WE UNDERSTAND THAT BOMB SCARE ALSO OCCURRED
AT AIRPORT 2 JULY, LEADING TO EVACUATION OF TERMINAL. INTERIOR
MINISTER SHAYKH SA'D AL-ABDULLAH REPORTEDLY DELIVERED REPORT TO
COUNCIL OF MINISTERS ON SECURITY SITUATION AT WEEKLY SESSION
TODAY, AND THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT AUTHORITIES VERY SERIOUS
ABOUT PROSPECTS FOR VIOLENCE HERE IN NEAR FUTURE.

** 252173 1976STATE166537 0.007083929 | 1976-07-05 | STATE | SECRETARY | PRINCE FAHD'S VIEWS ON ARAB/ISRAELI SETTLEMENT
1.  PRIOR TO PROVIDING PRINCE FAHD WITH YOUR VIEWS ON
PROBLEMS OF MOVING TOWARD GENERAL SETTLEMENT OF ISRAELI-ARAB
ISSUES AS THEY EMERGED IN PARIS MEETING, I BELIEVED HE WAS
OF OPINION THAT SUCH AN EFFORT SHOULD NOT BE ATTEMPTED UNTIL
AFTER ELECTIONS.  HE CORRECTED MY IMPRESSION, SAYING THAT HE
AGREED THAT NOTHING WOULD BE PRACTICAL UNTIL REPUBLICANS
NOMINATE THEIR CANDIDATE FOR THE PRESIDENCY, BUT HE HOLDS THAT
USG CAN AND SHOULD IMMEDIATELY AFTER THAT EVENT MOUNT AN
EFFORT TO NEGOTIATE A GENERAL SETTLEMENT AND SHOULD PROVIDE ITS
OWN VIEWS AS TO WHAT THAT MIGHT INCLUDE.  FAHD BELIEVES THAT
ALL PRINCIPAL FACTORS, MEANING ISRAELI, ARAB, U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL
OPINION ARE READY FOR SUCH AN EFFORT AND THAT TO AWAIT THE
OUTCOME OF THE U.S. ELECTIONS WOULD DIMINISH RATHER THAN
ENHANCE THE PROSPECTS FOR SUCCESS.
2.  HE ADDS THAT THE AMERICAN PUBLIC, WHICH IS THE MOST
IMPORTANT ELEMENT IN THE EQUATION, IS NOW SUFFICIENTLY EDUCATED
ABOUT ARAB-ISRAELI ISSUES, AND IS AWARE THAT LOGIC AND JUSTICE
ARE NOT ALL ON ONE SIDE.  AMERICANS ARE AWARE THAT OUR
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE EXISTENCE AND SECURITY OF THE STATE OF
ISRAEL IS CLEAR AND THAT WE CANNOT DIVEST OURSELVES OF THAT
RESPONSIBILITY.  AT SAME TIME HE BELIEVES THE AMERICAN PUBLIC
IS MORE THAN TIRED OF POLITICAL ISOLATION, THE EXPENSE AND THE
MANEUVERING WHICH HAVE KEPT THE PROBLEM IN THE FOREFRONT OF
AMERICAN DOMESTIC POLITICS FOR SO LONG.
3.  FAHD SAID THESE THINGS TO ME AND MORE.  HIS HOPE THAT
PRESIDENT FORD'S CAMPAIGN WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL WAS CLEARLY
EXPRESSED AND, ONCE THE NOMINATING PROCESS ENDS, HE SEES THE
INTERIM BETWEEN IT AND ELECTION DAY AS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR
ACTION RATHER THAN STAGNATION.  AMERICANS ADMIRE THE PRESIDENT'S
POLITICAL COURAGE, HE DECLARED, AND WOULD ADMIRE HIM MORE FOR
ACTION DESIGNED TO SETTLE THE PROBLEM.  HE WOULD NOT LISTEN TO
MY COMMENT THAN AN ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE CHARACTER HE HAD IN
MIND MIGHT EMBITTER THE CAMPAIGN.  THE CAMPAIGN HAD ALREADY
DEMONSTRATED THAT ZIONIST SUPPORT COULD NOT ACHIEVE A GREAT DEAL
FOR THOSE CANDIDATES WHO HAD IT, HE DECLARED.
4.  AS FOR LEBANON, HE APPRECIATED HEARING AGAIN THAT WE DO
NOT FAVOR PARTITION.  HE ADDED THAT WOULD NOT EVEN BE IN THE
INTEREST OF THE IERAELIS, THOUGH THEY MIGHT THINK IT IS.  HE
OBVIOUSLY FEARS THE DISINTEGRATING AND GENERALLY DANGEROUS EFFECT
OF THE PLO PRESENCE IN LEBANON AND SAID THAT RECENT EVENTS HAD
MADE THE NECESSITY OF GETTING THEM BACK INTO THEIR HOMELAND,
THE WEST BANK, EVEN CLEARER.
5.  RETURNING TO THE SUBJECT OF A GENERAL SETTLEMENT OF THE ARAB-
ISRAELI PROBLEM, HE INSISTED THAT AN AMERICAN EFFORT TO ACHIEVE
"PEACE AND TRANQUILITY IN RETURN FOR ARAB TERRITORIES TAKEN OVER
BY ISRAEL IN 1967" WOULD EVOKE WIDESPREAD ARAB, ISLAMIC AND
INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT.

1. REFTEL (A) JUST RECEIVED. ASSUME NO ACTION IS TO BE
TAKEN WITH GOE UNTIL AND UNLESS UNSC IS CALLED INTO
SESSION TO DEBATE ISRAELI RESCUE OPERATION.
2. GOE, IN PERSON OF FAHMY, HAS PUBLICLY CONDEMNED
ISRAELI OPERATION. HIS EVEN STRONGER DENUNCIATION,
AS GIVEN TO AMBASSADOR, WAS REPORTED REFTEL B (EXDIS).
HE DISMISSES PUBLIC CHARGES OF UGANDAN COLLABORATION
WITH HIJACKERS AS ISRAELI FABRICATIONS INTENDED JUSTIFY
WHAT HE REGARDS AS AN ILLEGAL ISRAELI ACTION. FAHMY'S
REACTION IS BASED PARTLY ON CHAGRIN THAT ISRAELIS COULD
SUCCESSFULLY MOUNT SUCH AN OPERATION AND PARTLY ON OAU
CONSIDERATIONS. HE HAS SAID THAT GOE WILL SUPPORT
UGANDAN CALL FOR UNSC MEETING IF SUCH CALL IS MADE.
AT SUCH MEETING, GOE MAY BE EXPECTED ASSOCIATE ITSELF
WITH THOSE DEMANDING A RESOLUTION CONDEMNING ISRAELI
ACTION.
3. AT SAME TIME, GOE IS PUBLICLY ON RECORD AS OPPOSING
TERRORISM, WHICH WOULD BE PEG ON WHICH A DEMARCHE COULD
BE HUNG TO REQUEST SUPPORT FOR AN OPERATIVE PARA RE
EVERY GOVERNMENT'S OBLIGATION TO END ACTS OF TERRORISM.
PROBLEM THIS INSTANCE WILL BE THAT, DESPITE GENERAL
NATURE OF PROPOSED PARA, GOE WILL RECOGNIZE IT IS
DIRECTED AGAINST UGANDA AND WILL PROBABLY OPPOSE IT.
IF THERE IS TO BE ANY CHANCE OF GETTING GOE TO GO ALONG,
WE WILL HAVE TO PROVIDE
FAHMY WITH SOME STRONG EVIDENCE
OF UGANDAN INVOLVEMENT IN AIDING AND ABETTING HIJACKERS.
EVEN WITH CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE TO THAT EFFECT, GOE MAY
STILL FIND IT POLITICALLY NECESSARY FOLLOW OAU CONSENSUS.

 * 170771 1976PORTL00596 0.007081494 | 1976-07-06 | PORT LOUIS | STATE | 13TH ORDINARY OAU SUMMIT: OVERALL IMPRESSIONS SUMMARY. THE 13TH  ORDINARY OAU SUMMIT DISPLAYED UNANIMITY
SUMMARY. THE 13TH ORDINARY OAU SUMMIT DISPLAYED UNANIMITY
IN PREDICTABLE AREAS, FOR EXAMPLE HARSH CRITICISM OF SOUTH
AFRICA OVER THE SOWETO KILLINGS, OF ISRAEL FOR THE COMMANDO
RAID AT ENTEBBE, OF FRANCE FOR SEPARATING MAYOTTE FROM THE
COMORES. BUT ON THE ISSUES OF SUBSTANCE RATHER THAN
RHETORIC THE GENERAL IMPRESSION CREATED WAS ONE OF SISHARMONY,
ACRIMONY AND UNWILLINGNESS TO COMPROMISE. OAU MEMBERS
SHOWED AN ABILITY TO UNITE ON CERTAIN BASIC ISSUES OF
IMPORTANCE TO THEM SUCH AS THE LIBERATION OF SOUTHERN
AFRICA, BUT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THEIR ENERGIES WERE OFTEN
DISSIPATED ON DISPUTES WITH THEIR NEIGHBORS OVER EVEN MORE
COMPELLING ISSUES INVOLVING TERRITORY OR IDEOLOGY.
END SUMMARY.
1. ACCORDING TO SOME PEOPLE WHO ATTEND OAU MEETINGS
REGULARLY, THE ORGANIZATION AND FACILITIES FOR THE 13TH
ORDINARY SUMMIT WERE AMONG THE BEST EVER. FEW HEADS OF
STATE AND GOVERNMENT TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE WARM HOSPITALITY
OF MAURITIUS, HOWEVER, AS ATTENDANCE BY THE LEADING POLITICALR
FIGURES OF AFRICA FELL TO ITS LOWEST LEVEL IN THE HISTORY
OF THE ORGANIZATION. A FEW DID SHOW UP -- NOTABLY SENGHOR,
AMIN, NIMEIRI, BONGO, OULD DADDAH, MANCHAM, JAWARA,
TEFERI BANTE, KAUNDA -- BUT MOST STAYED AWAY. SPECULATION
HERE ABOUT THE REASONS FOR THE ABSENCES STRESSED THE DISTANCE
OF MAURITIUS FROM MOST AFRICAN CAPITALS, PROTOCOLAIRE
RESERVATIONS ABOUT HOST RAMGOOLAM'S LESSER STATUS AS A
MERE HEAD OF GOVERNMENT, AND, ESPECIALLY, FEARS OF A
POSSIBLE COUP AT HOME AGAINST A LEADER ATTENDING THE
CONFERENCE (AS HAPPENED LAST YEAR TO GOWON OF NIGERIA, AND
AS NEARLY HAPPENED THIS YEAR TO NIMEIRI OF THE SUDAN).
2. THE NAME OF THE ORGANIZATION AND ITS MOTTO ("WE WILL
NOT BE DIVIDED") WERE THE SOURCE OF IRONIC AMUSEMENT, FOR
DISUNITY PREVAILED OVER UNITY IN MANY OF THE DELIBERATIONS.
AFRICAN COUNTRIES WHOSE CONFLICTS DOMINATED THE SESSIONS
INCLUDED ETHIOPIA VS. SOMALIA OVER THE FTAI, ALGERIA VS.
MORROCCO AND MAURITANIA OVER THE WESTERN SAHARA, UGANDA
VS. KENYA OVER THE ISRAALI COMMANDO RAID AT ENTEBBE, AND
SUDAN VS. LIBYA OVER THE COUP ATTEMPT AGAINST NIMEIRI.
THERE WAS ADDIDTIONAL DIVISIVENESS AMONG THE FACTIONS OF THE
ANC OF ZIMBABWE. THE UGANDA-KENYA AND SUDAN-LIBYA DISPUTES
ERUPTED ON THE FINAL DAY OF THE CONFERENCE AND MOVED ON TO
OTHER FORA SUCH AS THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL. THE FTAI
ISSUE WAS PARTIALLY SMOOTHED OVER, WITH FURTHER CONSIDERATION
POSTPONED TO A ROUND-TABLE CONFERENCE OF ALL FTAI FACTIONS
TO BE HELD IN ACCRA NEXT MONTH. THE DISPUTE OVER WESTERN
SAHARA WAS THE MOST SERIOUS OF ALL, WITH MOROCCO AND
MAURITANIA THREATENING TO LEAVE THE OAU IF THE MATTER WAS
EVEN DISCUSSED. THIS ISSUE WAS PUT FORWARD FOR LATER
CONSIDERATION BY A SPECIAL OAU SUMMIT, AND IT REMAINS FAR
FROM SETTLED.
3. AS IS PERHAPS NORMAL, THE OAU CONFERENCE THIS YEAR
WAS DOMINATED BY ISSUES AND PROBLEMS WHICH CAME INTO PRO-
MINENCE JUST BEFORE OR DURING THE MEETINGS. THE COUNCIL
OF MINISTERS CONFERENCE HIGHLIGHTED THE SOWETO RIOTS WHICH
SHORTLY PRECEDED THE OPENING SESSION. THE SUMMIT ITSELF
TURNED MUCH OF ITS ATTENTION TO THE ISRAELI RAID ON ENTEBBE
WHICH OCCURED IN THE MIDST OF THE CONFERENCE, AND THE COUP
ATTEMPT AGAINST NIMEIRI, WHICH TOOK PLACE JUST PRIOR TO THE
SUMMIT OPENING. ALTHOUGH PRACTICALLY ALL OF THE RESOLUTIONS
PREPARED BY THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS (WITH THE NOTABLE
EXCEPTION OF THE ONE ON WESTERN SAHARA) WERE ADOPTED WITHOUT
DIFFICULTY, THE PUBLIC IMAGE OF THE OAU MEETING WAS ONE
OF DISHARMONY AND CONTROVERSY BECAUSE OF THESE DIVISION-
CAUSING EXTERNAL EVENTS.
4. FRANCE AND ISRAEL WERE THE PRINCIPAL NON-AFRICAN TARGETS
OF OAU RHETORIC AT THE 1976 MEETING. FRANCE WAS ATTACKED
FOR SUPLLYING NECLEAR PLANTS TO SOUTH AFRICA, FOR SEPARATING
MAYOTTE FROM THE COMOROS AND FOR ALLEGED FOOT-DRAGGING ON
GRANTING INDEPENDENCE TO THE FTAI. BESIDES THE ENTEBBE
INCIDENT, ISRAEL'S "CRIME" WAS ALLEGED COOPERATION WITH
SOUTH AFRICA, HIGHLIGHTED BY VORSTER'S VISIT TO ISRAEL.
SOUTH AFRICA ITSELF WAS OF COURSE THE FAVORITE TARGET OF
ALL, WITH THE FOCUS ON SOWETO AS THE MOST SERIOUS INSTANCE
OF SAG VIOLENCEIAGAINST THE COUNTRY'S BLACK MAJORITY SINCE
SHARPEVILLE. ECONOMIC TIES AND SPORTS LINKS WITH SOUTH
AFRICA WERE CRITICIZED, AND NEW ZEALAND WAS SINGLED OUT
BECAUSE OF THE TOUR OF ITS ALL BLACKS RUGBY TEAM TO
SOUTH AFRICA. A BOYCOTT OF THE OLYMPICS WAS RECOMMENDED IF
NEW ZEALAND IS ALLOWED TO PARTICIPATE. THE KOREAN QUESTION
WAS NOT RAISED OR EVEN MENTIONED BY ANYONE AT THE CONFERENCE.
5. THE UNITED STATES GOT OFF LIGHTLY, IN THEM VIEW OF ALL
OBSERVERS. THE SHARPEST CRITICISM DIRECTED AGAINST THE
USG WAS OVER OUR VETO OF ANGOLA'S ADMISSION TO THE UN.
A NUMBER OF SPEAKERS MENTIONED THIS, NOT EXCEPTING UNSYG
WALDHEIM (WHO, THOUGH HE DID NOT MENTION THE US BY NAME,
EXPRESSED THE HOPE THAT ANGOLA WOULD BE PERMITTED TO JOIN
THE UN IN KEEPING WITH THE PRINCIPLE OF UNIVERSALITY).
WE WERE ALSO CRITICIZED FOR FAILING TO PAY OUR DUES TO
UNESCO, WITH THE THREAT THAT ACTION WOULD BE TAKEN TO CANCEL
OUR VOTING RIGHTS. SOME SPEAKERS MENTIONED ALLEGED COLLABORA-
TION WITH SOUTH AFRICA, WITH REFERENCES TO SECRETARY
KISSINGER'S MEETING WITH VORSTER, BUT PRIVATELQ MOST
DELEGATES WERE MORE CURIOUS ABOUT POSSIBLE RESULTS FROM
THE TALKS THAN CRITICAL OF THEIR HAVING BEEN HELD.
6. THE FOLLOWING WERE THE PRIXNCIPAL TOPICS AND THEMES
RAISED BY OAU DELEGATES IN CONVERSATIONS WITH ME AT THE
SEVERAL PUBLIC FUNCTIONS AND CEREMONIES: (A) HARSH CRITICISM
OF THE FRENCH NECLEAR DEAL WITH SOUTH AFRICA AND THE
THREAT THAT BLACK AFRICAN STATES WOULD HAVE TO OBTAIN NUCLEAR
ARMS BY ANY MEANS POSSIBLE TO COUNTER THE SOUTH AFRICAN
DANGER; (B) A STRONGLY NEGATIVE REACTION TO THE US VETO OF
ANGOLA'S MEMBERSHIP IN THE UN; (C) SOME CRITICISM OF THE
GREATLY INCREASED MILITARY ASSISTANCE TO KENYA AND ZAIRE
AS REPRESENTING THE "INTRODUCTION" OF COLD WAR COMPETITION
TO AFRICA; (D) INTEREST IN THE KISSINGER-VORSTER TALKS;
(E) GENEROUS PRAISE FOR AMBASSADOR SCRANTON, BOTH FOR HIS
PERFORMANCE AT THE UN AND ON HIS TOUR OF AFRICA; (F) AD-
VOCACY OF ACTIVE AND DIRECT SUPPORT BY THE US TO THE AFRICAN
LIBERATION MOVEMENTS, WITH THE THREAT THAT OTHERWISE THESE
MOVEMENTS WOULD HAVE TO TURN TO THE COMMUNIST POWERS FOR
THE ARMS THEY NEED.
7. ALTHOUGH ISRAEL WAS ROUNDLY CRITICIZED, IN GENERAL AND
FOR THE ENTEBBE RAID, MIDDLE EAST ISSUES AS UUCH DID NOT
FIGURE PROMINENTLY IN THE DEBATES AND IN FACT WERE NOTABLE
FOR THEIR ABSENCE FROM THIS OAU SESSION. UNSYG WALDHEIM
STARTLED MANY BY SPENDING MORE TIME ON THE MIDDLE EAST IN
HIS SPEECH TO THE OAU OPENING THAN ANY OF THE AFRICAN
LEADERS. INCLUDING THE ARABS, DID IN THEIRS. THE US WAS
MENTIONED NEGATIVELY AS A SUPPORTER OF ISRAEL, BUT NOT
IN AN EXTREME FASHION.
8. THE STAR PERSONALITY AT THE CONFERENCE WAS OF COURSE
IDI AMIN, BECAUSE OF HIS SIZE, HIS CHESTFUL OF GLITTERING
MEDALS, HIS HALF-LITERATE HALF-COMIC IMPROVISATIONS, AND
THE IMAGE OF BRUTE, POTENTIALLY EXPLOSIVE STRENGTH HE RADIATES.
HIS LECTURES ABOUT THE NEED FOR UNITY AND HIS
BOAST THAT HE WILL MARCH HIS TROOPS TO CAPE TOWN WERE
HEARTILY IF MIRTHFULLY APPLAUDED, AND FORTUNATELY FOR HIM
HE WAS GONE FROM MAURITIUS BY THE TIME THE ISRAELIS GAVE
VIVID PROOF OF HIS INABILITY EVEN TO DEFEND HIS OWN AIRPORT.

2.  NAIK TOOK A VERY HARDLINE AGAINST ISRAELI ACTION.
HE SAID GOP COULD NOT PUT THE HIJACKING AND THE
SUBSEQUENT ISRAELI OPERATION ON SAME PLANE.  OFFICIAL
GOP POSITION, HE SAID, HAD ALREADY BEEN SPELLED OUT IN
PRESS STATEMENT JUST RELEASED,  TEXT OF WHICH HAD BEEN
CABLED TO PAK PERMREP IN NEW YORK.  GOP HAD ALSO SENT

TELLING HIM TO SUPPORT A DRAFT RESOLUTION CONDEMNING

JUST A CONDEMNATION OF "THOSE WHO HAD SUPPORTED"  THE

3.  TEXT OF THE GOP STATEMENT "CONDEMNING ISRAEL'S
TERRORIST ATTACK AGAINST THE PEOPLE OF UGANDA " FOLLOWS:
" THE GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN EXPRESSES ITS SENSE OF
PROFOUND SHOCK OVER ISRAEL'S BRAZEN ACT OF AGGRESSION
AGAINST THE PEOPLE AND THE STATE SOVEREIGNTY OF UGANDA.
ISRAELI ARMED FORCES ATTACKED THE ENTEBBE AIRPORT IN
UGANDA ON THE NIGHT OF JULY 3 CAUSING SERIOUS DAMAGE TO
LIFE AND PROPERTY THERE.  DRAWING ATTENTION TO ITS
CONSISTENT OPPOSITION TO ISRAEL'S POLICY OF AGGRESSION,
THE GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN CONDEMNS THE ISRAELI ATTACK
ON THE ENTEBBE AIRPORT AND EXPRESSES PAKISTAN'S
SOLIDARITY WITH THE GOVERNMENT AND THE PEOPLE OF UGANDA.
THIS BLATANT AGGRESSION DEMONSTRATED ONCE AGAIN
ISRAEL'S TOTAL DISREGARD FOR THE PRINCIPLES OF
SOVEREIGNTY AND TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY OF STATES AND
ITS LACK OF RESPECT FOR AFRICAN AND ARAB LIVES.
"THIS WAS, HOWEVER, NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT ISRAEL
HAD VIOLATED, WITH TOTAL IMPUNITY, THE CHARTER OF
THE UNITED NATIONS AND HAD LAUNCHED UNPROVOKED AGGRESSION
AGAINST A SOVEREIGN STATE.  THE LAST TWENTY-EIGHT
YEARS ABOUND WITH INNUMERABLE ACTS OF AGGRESSION
COMMITTED BY ISRAEL IN FURTHERANCE OF ITS EXPANSIONIST
DESIGNS.  THE LATEST ACT OF ISRAELI AGGRESSION WAS
SPECIALLY SHOCKING SINCE PRESIDENT IDI AMIN HAD
PERSONALLY BEEN NEGOTIATING THE RELEASE OF THE
HOSTAGES WITH THE HIJACKERS AND HAD ALREADY SUCCEEDED
IN SECURING THE RELEASE OF OVER 150 PERSONS."
4.  IN FURTHER DISCUSSION, NAIK REITERATED THAT GOP
DRAWS A DISTINCTION BETWEEN HIJACKINGS BY INDIVIDUAL
TERRORISTS, WHICH IT CONDEMNS, AND THOSE CARRIED OUT BY
RECOGNIZED LIBERATION ORGANIZATIONS IN PURSUANCE OF THEIR
EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE SELF-DETERMINATION.  PAKISTAN, HE
SAID, WOULD SUPPORT ANY MEASURES AT THE UN TO PROTEST
THE FIRST CATEGORY OF HIJACKINGS.  AS FOR THE SECOND,
HE SAID THAT ACTION MUST BE TAKEN TO REMOVE THE
FUNDAMENTAL REASONS WHY THEY TAKE PLACE.  ASKED IN
WHICH CATEGORY HE THOUGHT THE LATEST HIJACKING FELL,
NAIK REPLIED THAT THE ISRAELI ACTION HAD GIVEN A NEW
COMPLEXION TO THE AFFAIR.
5.  NAIK STOUTLY DEFENDED IDI AMIN'S ROLE CLAIMING THAT
THE UGANDAN PRESIDENT HAD BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR RELEASE
OF MANY HOSTAGES AND THAT HE WAS MAKING FURTHER PROGRESS WHEN
ISRAELIS INTERVENED.  CITING HIS OWN ROLE IN THE
SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS TO DEAL WITH ARAB HIJACKERS WHO HAD
SEIZED CONTROL OF A GREEK SHIP IN KARACHI HARBOR IN 1974,
NAIK MAINTAINED THAT NEGOTIATIONS SUCH AS THOSE AMIN
HAD REPORTEDLY MOUNTED TOOK MUCH TIME AND PATIENCE.
THE ISRAELIS HAD NO JUSTIFICATION WHATEVER FOR ACTING
AS THEY DID AND THEIR ACTION MIGHT WELL HAVE ADVERSE
REPERCUSSIONS ON THEM.
COMMENT:  NAIK'S REACTION COMES AS NO SURPRISE.  AS
MUSLIM COUNTRY CHAMPIONING ARAB CAUSE AND CONSTANTLY
SEEKING TO ASSOCIATE ITSELF WITH THIRD WORLD CAUSES,
PAKISTAN COULD BE EXPECTED TO JOIN WITH ARAB/AFRICAN
MOVES CONDEMING ISRAELIS, HOWEVER MUCH INDIVIDUAL PAKS
MAY SECRETLY ADMIRE BOLDNESS OF GOI ACTION.

SEIZED CONTROL OF A GREEK SHIP IN KARACHI HARBOR IN 1974,
NAIK MAINTAINED THAT NEGOTIATIONS SUCH AS THOSE AMIN
HAD REPORTEDLY MOUNTED TOOK MUCH TIME AND PATIENCE.
THE ISRAELIS HAD NO JUSTIFICATION WHATEVER FOR ACTING
AS THEY DID AND THEIR ACTION MIGHT WELL HAVE ADVERSE
REPERCUSSIONS ON THEM.
COMMENT:  NAIK'S REACTION COMES AS NO SURPRISE.  AS
MUSLIM COUNTRY CHAMPIONING ARAB CAUSE AND CONSTANTLY
SEEKING TO ASSOCIATE ITSELF WITH THIRD WORLD CAUSES,
PAKISTAN COULD BE EXPECTED TO JOIN WITH ARAB/AFRICAN
MOVES CONDEMING ISRAELIS, HOWEVER MUCH INDIVIDUAL PAKS
MAY SECRETLY ADMIRE BOLDNESS OF GOI ACTION.

1.  SWEDISH FOREIGN MINISTER SVEN ANDERSSON HAS
RELEASED A STATEMENT EXPRESSING THE SWEDISH GOVERNMENT'S
RELIEF AT THE RESCUE OF THE HOSTAGES FROM ENTEBBE
AIRPORT. UNOFFICIAL TRANSLATION FOLLOWS:
2.  "THE SWEDISH GOVERNMENT HAS WITH GREAT RELIEF
RECEIVED THE INFORMATION THAT ALMOST ALL THOSE WHO WERE
TAKEN HOSTAGE - AMONG THEM THE SWEDISH CITIZEN ANN-CARINA
FRANKING - HAVE ESCAPED UNHARMED FROM THE HIJACKING DRAMA
IN UGANDA. AT THE SAME TIME THE GOVERNMENT WISHES TO
EXPRESS ITS DEEP SYMPATHY WITH THE PERSONS FROM SEVERAL
COUNTRIES WHO HAVE LOST A CLOSE RELATIVE. THE
GOVERNMENT HAS REPEATEDLY STRONGLY CONDEMNED THE TAKING
OF HOSTAGES AND OTHER TYPES OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.
IT IS ENTIRELY UNACCEPTABLE THAT IRRESPONSIBLE AND
CRIMINAL GROUPS ATTACK PRIVATE CITIZENS THIS WAY. THIS
HIJACKING DRAMA CAUSES THE SWEDISH GOVERNMENT TO
SHARPLY REPEAT THIS VIEWPOINT. HOWEVER, THIS DOES
NOT MEAN THAT WE TAKE A STAND ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW
ASPECTS OF WHAT JUST HAPPENED. THE GOVERNMENT WILL
HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT ITS VIEWS ON THIS AT THE
EXPECTED DEBATE IN THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL."

DEVELOPING COUNTRIES: AGENDA ITEM 11
1. SUMMARY. THE UNDP SESSIONAL COMMITTEE ON TCDC,
MEETING FOR THE SECOND TIME, 1) DISCUSSED AT LENGTH THE

ON TCDC BY THE UNDP ADMINISTRATOR IN WHICH HE REITERATED
HIS PERSONAL COMMITMENT TO THE CONCEPT OF TCDC; DECLARED
THAT HE WOULD CONSULT WITH UN AGENCIES TO ASSURE THAT
IMPLEMENTATION OF TCDC MOVED AHEAD FASTER; AND
PLEDGED HE WOULD DO HIS UTMOST TO MAKE THE WORLD TCDC
CONFERENCE NEXT YEAR A SUCCESS.
3. IN ACCORDANCE WITH DECISIONS OF THE TWENTIETH AND
TWENTY-FIRST SESSIONS OF THE GOVERNING COUNCIL, THE
COMMITTEE HAD TWO MAJOR ISSUES BEFORE IT: ONE WAS
THE ORGANIZATIONAL AND FINANCIAL ASPECTS OF THE WORLD
CONFERENCE; THE OTHER WAS A PRELIMINARY EXCHANGE OF
VIEWS ON THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE REPORT OF THE
WORKING GROUP ON TCDC.
4. MEMBERS COMMENDED THE RESULTS OF THE ASIAN AND
LATING AMERICAN REGIONAL MEETINGS ALREADY HELD PREPA-
RATORY TO THE CONFERENCE ON TCDC. IT WAS POINTED OUT
THAT THE BANGKOK MEETING IDENTIFIED SEVERAL AREAS
ESPECIALLY SUITABLE FOR TCDC ACTIVITIES WHILE THE LIMA
MEETING PROPOSED A MAJOR TCDC PROJECT AMONG MEMBERS
OF THE REGIONA, TO BE ASSISTED AN FINANCED BY UNDP.
WHILE TCDC HAD BEEN ADVANCED AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL,
IN THE VIEW OF SOME MEMBERS MORE INTEREGIONAL COOPERA-
TION WAS NEEDED.
5. THE COMMITTEE THEN DISCUSSED AT LENGTH DP/202,
ORGANIZATION OF THE CONFERENCE, MOST ESPECIALLY CON-
FERENCE ARRANGEMENTS, CONFERENCE FINANCING ISSUES,
CONFERENCE DOCUMENTATION, CONFERENCE PARTICIPANTS
(WITH NEW EMPHASIS ON THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF ORGANIZA-
TIONS OF THE UN SYSTEM AND PRIVATE ENTITIES), THE PROPOSED
PROVISIONAL AGENDA, AND INFORMATION ACTIVITIES.
6. AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT POINTS RAISED AND DECI-
SIONS TAKEN WERE:
A) WITH RESPECT TO THE CONFERENCE ON TCDC, THE
REPRESENTATIVE OF ARGENTINA ANNOUNCED THAT THE INVITA-
TION HAD NOW BEEN FORMALIZED IN DOCUMENT A/31/82.
LATER THE COUNCIL PROPOSED THAT THE CONFERENCE BE HELD
FROM 23 AUGUST TO 6 SEPTEMBER, 1977 IN BUENOS AIRES,
ARGENTINA.
B) IT WAS AGREED THAT THE SESSIONAL COMMITTEE ON
TCDC SHOULD ACT AS THE PREPARATORY COMMITTEE FOR THE

COMMITTEE.
C) THE COMMITTEE AGREED TO RECOMMEND TO THE
GOVERNING COUNCIL THAT THE COUNCIL SHOULD DEVOTE THE
FIRST WEEK OF ITS TWENTY-THIRD SESSION TO THE PREPARA-
TORY COMMITTEE IN ORDER TO FACILITATE ITS WORK.
D) VARIOUS MEMBERS, WHILE EXPRESSING THEIR AWARE-
NESS OF UNDP'S FINANCIAL STRINGENCIES, NONETHELESS
VOICED CONCERN LEST THE PROPOSED BUDGET FOR THE PREPA-
TIONS FOR THE CONFERENCE FALL SHORT OF MEETING ALL ACTUAL
NEEDS.
E) THERE WAS GENERAL AGREEMENT ON THE NEED FOR
ASSISTANCE FROM THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COUNCIL
SECRETARIAT IN THE VIEW OF ITS EXTENSIVE WORLD
CONFERENCE EXPERIENCE.
F) MEMBERS EXPRESSED THE VIEW THAT DOCUMENTATION
SHOULD BE KEPT TO A MINIMUM AND EMPHASIZED THE IMPOR-
TANCE OF ONE CLEAR AND CONCISE SUMMARY PRESENTATION
FOR GENERAL DISCUSSION.
G) THE VIEW WAS EXPRESSED THAT SOME OF THE PRO-
POSED AGENDA ITEMS READ MORE LIKE STATEMENTS OF PRIN-
CIPLE THAN ISSUES FOR DISCUSSION AND THAT IT NEEDED
TO BE REVISED AND EXPANDED.
H) IT WAS SUGGESTED THAT THE GOVERNING COUNCIL
RECOMMEND THE UNITED NATIONS OFFICE OF PUBLIC INFORMA-
TION (OPI) BE REQUESTED TO MAKE TCDC ONE OF ITS FIVE
ITEMS OF SPECIAL EMPHASIS FOR THE YEAR 1977.
I) IT WAS GENERALLY ACCEPTED THAT, AS HAD BEEN
THE CASE AT THE RECENT HABITAT CONFERENCE, ARABIC
SHOULD BE ADDED AS A SIXTH OFFICIAL LANGUAGE FOR THE
CONFERENCE.
7. A NUMBER OF SUGGESTIONS PUT FORTH BY THE US DELE-
GATION RECEIVED CONSIDERABLE SUPPORT INCLUDING THAT:
A) THERE WAS NO NEED TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF
PROPOSED UNDP FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR CONFERENCE PREPARA-
TIONS -- AT LEAST FOR THE MOMENT;
B) PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS SHOULD ALSO BE INVITED
TO THE CONFERENCE;
C) THE ROLE OF WOMEN IN TCDC SHOULD BE ADDED TO
THE PROPOSED AGENDA OF THE WORLD CONFERENCE;
D) THAT "SOCIAL" COOPERATION SHOULD ALSO BE ADDED
TO THE PROPOSED AGENDA WITH "CULTURAL" COOPERATION
BEING DELETED; AND
E) THERE BE NO SOUND RECORDINGS MADE OF THE DELIBERATIONS
OF THE WORKING GROUP AT THE WORLD
CONFERENCE.
8. RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE WORKING GROUP. AFTER
COMPLETING ITS DISCUSSION OF CONFERENCE ARRANGEMENTS,
THE COMMITTEE UNDERTOOK A BRIEF, VERY PRELIMINARY DIS-
CUSSION OF A FEW OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE WORKING
GROUP ON TCDC (DP/69). THIS WAS DONE AT THE INSISTENCE
OF INDIA AND IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT THE COMMITTEE
DID NOT HAVE A DOCUMENT ON THE STATUS OF THE IMPLEMEN-
TATION OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM WHICH TO WORK.
9. VERY LITTLE WAS ACCOMPLISHED IN THE BRIEF, PARTIAL
REVIEW WITH ONLY THE FIRST THREE OF THE THIRTY-THREE
RECOMMENDATIONS BEING DISCUSSED.
10. MEMBERS WERE THEN ASKED TO SUGGEST GUIDELINES FOR
THE USE OF THE ADMINISTRATION IN DRAWING UP A REPORT ON
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE WORKING GROUP'S RECOMMENDATIONS
TO GUIDE THE COMMITTEE'S REVIEW OF ALL THE RECOMMEN-
DATIONS AT THE NEXT MEETING OF THE COUNCIL IN JANUARY.
1. THE COMMITTEE CONCLUDED ITS WORK BY DRAFTING TWO
DETAILED DECISIONS WHICH, ALONG WITH ITS REPORT, WERE
APPROVED BY THE GOVERNING COUNCIL.
12. FOLLOWING APPROVAL OF THE COMMITTEE'S REPORT BY
THE GOVERNING COUNCIL, THE ISRAELI OBSERVER TO THE
COUNCIL'S PROCEEDINGS (WHO HAD TAKEN NO PART IN THE
COMMITTEE'S PROCEEDINGS) LODGED A RESERVATION POINTING
OUT THAT UNDER THE PARTICIPANT FORMULA PROPOSED FOR
THE TCDC WORLD CONFERENCE AN ILLEGAL LIBERATION MOVEMENT,
THE PLO, WOULD BE PERMITTED TO ATTEND AND TO ONCE AGAIN
JEOPARDIZE THE WORK OF AN IMPORTANT WORLD CONFERENCE
AS HAD BEEN THE CASE AT THE RECENT HABITAT CONFERENCE.
THE REMARKS OF THE ISRAELI OBSERVER WERE REBUTTED BY
KUWAIT, THE PRC AND THE USSR.ABRAMS

BY RADIO UGANDA AT 1700 GMT JULY 6.
BEGIN TEXT
TEXT: PRESIDENT AMIN HAS IN A MESSAGE TO MZEE JOMO
KENYATTA ASSURED ALL KENYANS THAT IN SPITE OF RECENT DEVELOPMENTS,
UGANDA STILL REGARDS THE ENTIRE PEOPLE OF KENYA AS OUR BROTHERS AND
SISTERS.
IN THE MESSAGE, WHICH WAS COPIED TO PRESIDENT JULIUS
NYERERE OF TANZANIA, FM AMIN SAID: I FELT COMPELLED TO ADDRESS YOU
DIRECTLY ON THE RECENT TRAGIC INVASION OF UGANDA BY THE FORCES
OF ZIONIST ISRAEL.
FROM ALL THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO ME, THE ISRAELI
INVASION OF UGANDA, MEMBER COUTRY OF THE EAST AFRICAN
COMMUNITY HAD BEEN CARRIED OUT WITH YOUR EXCELLENCY'S FULL
KNOWLEDGE, AS WELL AS THE AUTHORITY OF YOUR GOVERNMENT.
I THEREFORE (WORDS INDISTINCT) PERSONALLY AND THE PEOPLE
OF UGANDA IN GENERAL, NO LITTLE SURPRISE TO LEARN THAT YOUR
AUTHORITIES COULD READILY OBLIGE FACILITIES TO THE ZIONIST ISRAEL,
FOR LAUNCHING AN ATTACK ON UGANDA WHICH, AS YOU WELL KNOW, IS NOT
ONLY A FELLOW MEMBER OF THE AST AFRICAN COMMUNITY, THE OAU, THE
NON-ALIGNED MOVEMENT BUT ALSO OF THE UN.
FOLLOWING THE PAST HISTORY OF KENYA, DURING ITS STRUGGLE
AGAINST BRITISH COLONIALISM, IT IS OBVIOUS THAT BESIDES YOU
PERSONALLY MANY COUTRIES SUCH AS EGYPT, UNDER THE LATE ABD AL-NASR,
SYRIA, IRAQ AND EVEN THE PALIESTINIANS DID ACTUALLY CONTRIBUTE
IMMEDIATELY, BY PROVIDING KENYA FREEDOM FIGHTERS BOTH ALL THE
NECESSARY WEAPONS AND COMMUNICATIONS WHICH UNDOUBTEDLY ENABLED YOUR
COUNTRY TO OBTAIN HER INDEPENDENCE.
YOUR EXCELLENCY: YOU MAY FURTHER WISH TO NOTE THAT FROM
THE MORNING FOLLOWING THE NIGHT OF THE ZIONIST RAID, IT FURTHER
OCCASIONED ME NO LITTLE SURPRISE TO LEARN THAT YOUR EXCELLENCY
HAS SINCE THEN HEAVILY REINFORMCED THEIR (ED: AS HEARD) MILITARY
UNITS ALONG THE ENTIRE COMMON BORDER OF OUR TWO SISTER COUNTRIES AND,
AT SOME POINTS,FOR EXAMPLE IN LOMINO IN THE SOUTH, KENYAN TROOPS
HAVE EVEN CROSSED INTO UGANDAN TERRITORY, UP TO THREE MILES.
HOWEVER, IN SPITE OF THE RECENT DEVELOPMENTS WHICH HAVE
UNFORTUNATELY BUILT UP UNNECESSARY HIGH TENSION BETWEEN UGANDA AND
KENYA, WE, THE PEOPLE OF UGANDA, STILL REGARD THE ENTIRE PEOPLE OF
KENYA AS OUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS.
WOU SHOULD NOT THEREFORE WORRY OF ANY ATTACK FROM OUR
SIDE OF THE BORDER.
AS A STRONG BELIEVER IN THE EAST AFRICAN COMMUNITY, I AM
THEREFORE SENDING A COPY OF THIS MESSAGE TO OUR BROTHER PRESIDENT,
MWALIMU JULIUS NYERERE, THE OTHER MEMBER OF THE EAST AFRICAN
AUTHORITY, FOR INFORMATION.
I WISH HOWEVER, TO REITERATE TO YOU MY ASSURANCE THAT
KENYA SHOULD HAVE NO CAUSE TO WORRY ABOUT ANY POSSIBLE ATTACK FROM
UGANDA. END TEXT

1.  IT MAY BE OF INTEREST THAT SEVERAL WOULD-BE EMIGRANTS HAVE
TOLD US THAT THEY FEEL THE GOI DECISION NOT TO SEND "VYZOVS"
THROUGH THE DUTCH EMBASSY IN MOSCOW REPRESENTS A DELIBERATE
ATTEMPT ON THE PART OF THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT TO FORCE THEIR
HANDS.  WE KNOW OF THREE CASES OF MUSCOVITE JEWS, ONLY ONE OF THEM
"KNOWN TO SEEK EMIGRATION," WHO HAD ASKED TO HAVE THEIR "VYZOVS"
SENT THROUGH THE DUTCH EMBASSY, EITHER BECAUSE THEY HAD NOT
FINALLY DECIDED TO EMIGRATE, OR BECAUSE THEY FELT THEY MIGHT
BE ABLE TO AVOID TAKING THE ISRAELI ROUTE.  THE DUTCH TELL US
THEY HAVE NO DIFFICULTY IN AGREEING TO TRANSMIT THE "VYZOVSZ
NONE RECEIVED ANY RESPONSE UNTIL ABOUT TEN DAYS AGO, WHEN ALL
RECEIVED THE DOCUMENTS THROUGH THE SOVIET POST OFFICE.  THE
CASES CONCERN RELATIVES (OR POTENTIAL SPOUSES) OF FIGURES
PROMINENT ON THE SOVIET CULTURAL AND INTELLECTUAL SCENE.  IN THE
CASES OF WHICH WE ARE AWARE, THE RECIPIENTS HAVE TOLD US
(
SEPARATELY) THAT THEY FEEL THAT THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT DELIBER-
ATELY IGNORED THEIR WISHES AND SENT THE "VYZOVS" DIRECTLY IN
ORDER TO INSURE THAT THE RECIPIENTS, REALIZING THAT THE SOVIET
AUTHORITIES HAD TAKEN NOTE OF THE RECEIPT OF THE DOCUMENTATION,
WOULD THEN FEEL OBLIGED TO GO THROUGH WITH THE FORMAL APPLICATION
TO LEAVE THE USSR.
2.  JEWISH DISSIDENT LEADERS TELL US THAT THEY BELIEVE THERE
HAS BEEN A DECLINE IN THE NUMBER OF "VYZOVS" RECEIVED, ESPECIALLY
IN CITIES OUTSIDE MOSCOW.  THEY ATTIRBUTE THIS DECLINE TO
DECISIONS BY THE SOVIET AUTHORITIES, NOT TO ANY ISRAELI POLICY
CHANGES.

CINCUSAREUR HEIDELBERG GERMANY | LEBANESE SITUATION JULY 4: TELL ZAATAR BEING MOPPED UP;
1.  SUMMARY:  TELL ZAATAR BATTLE STILL NOT COMPLETELY OVER, AS
CHRISTIANS APPEAR CAREFUL TO AVOID ADVERSE PUBLICITY OF
BLOODBATH AT END.  INTENSIVE FIGHTING CONTINUES ALONG SECONDARY
FRONTS IN BEIRUT AREA, BUT PALESTINAINS UNABLE RELIEVE BESIEGED
CAMP, BLAMING ADVERSE SYRIAN ARTILLERY FIRE.  FIGHTING
ELSEWHERE IN BEIRUT AREA AND IN OTHER PARTS OF COUNTRY
INDECISIVE.  AL DELEGATION CALLS ON PALESTINIAN/LEFTIST SIDE AS
51ST CEASEFIRE FACES INTO OBLIVION.  FATAH DEPUTY KHALAF
BITTERLY DENOUNCES SYRIAN ROLE AND ARAB STATES' INDIFFERENCE TO
FATE OF TELL ZAATAR, THREATENS END OF ATTEMPTS AT DIALOGUE AND
REPRISALS AGAINST NUMEROUS ARAB REGIMES WHEN CAMP FALLS.
LEBANESE SIDES HARDEN ATTITUDES.  LARGE INTERNATIONAL CONVOY
DEPARTED BEIRUT FOR DAMASCUS EARLY JULY 4.  END SUMMARY.
2.  FOLLOWING GROUND ACTION LULL OF SEVERAL HOURS, DURING WHICH
SHELLING OF CAMP CONTINUED, CHRISTIANS AGAIN MOUNTED ASSAULTS
ON TELL ZAATAR AND ARE NOW WITHIN CAMP PERIMETER.  THOUGH
ASSAULT NOT ENTIRELY SUCCESSFUL, MAJOR GROUND ACTION HAS
:3- 3$.  CHRISTIANS APPEAR STILL UNWILLING TAKE HEAVY
CASUALTIES FINAL PUSH WOULD REQUIRE, BUT THEY ARE CLAIMING
CAMP HAS FALLEN AND ANNOUNCE ENEMY WOUNDED WILL BE TURNED
OVER TO RED CROSS ON JULY 5.  IN TELL ZAATAR AN IMMENSE
FIRE, VISIBLE SEVERAL MILES, BEOAN AT MIDNIGHT JULY 3, BUT WE
DO NOT KNOW CAUSE.  COMTWP
TDPALESTINIAN/LEFTIST ATTACK ON
KAHALE WAS SIMULTANEOUS WITH ASSAULTS ON BSOUSS, BDEDOUN,
HOUMAL AND ARAYA ALL IN SAME AREA.  ALL ASSAULTS
APPARENTLY UNSECCESSFUL.  PALESTINIANS HAVE ANGRILY DENOUNCED
SYRIANS FOR ASSISTING CHRISTIANS IN SEVERAL AREAS BY SHELLING
PALESTINIAN/LEFTIST FORCES, PARTICULARLY RELIEF FORCE AT MONTE
VERDE S
ONG TO RELIEVE TELL ZAATAR.  VIOLENT ARTILLERY
EXCHANGES CONTINUE ALONG BEIRUT'S EAST/WEST DIVIDING LINE
AND HEAVY BUT INDECISIVE FIGHTING CONTINUES AT CHWYAH/AIN
EL-RUMMANEH AND AT HADETH/LAYLAKE.
3.  ELSEWHERE, SYRIANS, HAVE STILL NOT COMPLETELY RETREATED
FROM SIDON AREA AND SHELLED VESSEL ATTEMPTING ENTER PORT JULY 3.
VESSEL SAID BY LEFTISTS TO BE CARRYING FLOUR, BUT THERE IS
EVIDENCE LIBYANS OR OTHERS THINKING ABOUT BRINGING IN ARMS
SHIPMENTS.  IN BEKAA CITIES AND IN NORTH LEBANON, SYRIAN
BLOCKADES AND FIGHTING CONTINUE.  PALESTINIAN SOURCES CLAIM
CLASHES WITH SYRIAN TROOPS INLAKKAR, AT HERMEL AND NEAR
OUYOUN EL-SIMANE.  HOWEVER, VIOLENCE IN FARAYA/OUYOUN
EL-SIMANE AREA APPEARS REDUCED TO ARTILLERY EXCHANGES.
VOICE OF LEBANON (KATAEB) ANNOUNCED NEW DEGENERATION OF
SITUATION IN NORTH LEBANON WITH BOMBARDMENTS IN AREAS OF
RAS-NAHACHE, HAMAT, CHEKKA, ENFE AND AIN IKRINE.
4.  DESPITE CEASEFIRE BREAKDOWN, AL DELEGATION CONTINUED
EFFORTS WITH JULY 3 VISIT TO WEST BEIRUT BY HELICOPTER FROM
DAMASCUS.  SECGEN RIAD, TUNISIAN AND BAHRAINI FOREIGN
MINISTERS, AS WELL AS DEPUTY SECGEN KHOLI AND AL MILITARY
FORCE CHIEF- OF - STAFF COL. CHEDID, MET WITH PALESTINIAN AND
LEFTIST OEADERS AT PLO POLITICAL DEPARTMENT HEADQUARTERS BEFORE
RETURN TO DAMASCUS FOR FURTHER CONSULTATIONS WITH SYRIANS.
ACCORDING TO LEBANESE ARAB ARMY-CONTROLLED RADIO LEBANON,
RIAD HAD ASKED FRANGIE AND GEMAYEL TO ALLOW AL FORCES INTO
TELL ZAATAR AS OBSERVERS.  WE HAVE NO WORD OF RESPONSE
ALTHOUGH RIGHTISTS THEMSELVES MADE SIMILAR REQUEST TO AL
DURING PAST WEEK.  AL THREESOME INTENDS PROCEED TO CAIRO
JULY 4, PERHAPS AFTER ANTOTHER VISIT TO LEB TTU
5.  FATAH NUMBER TWO SALAH KHALAF BROKE THROUGH THINLAYER OF
CORDIALITY REMAINING BETWEEN PALESTINIANS AND DAMASCUS IN
FIRST HIGH-LEVEL PALESTINIAN STATEMENT ATTACKING ASSAD
PERSONALLY AS AUTHOR OF PLOT.  KHALAF DESCRIBES MARONITE
"KFOUR FRONT" AS ONLY A SYRIAN INSTRUMENT AND ATTACK ON TELL
ZAATAR AS PART OF SYRIAN PLOT.  "IF TELL ZAATAR IS TAKEN WE WILL
ERASE THE WORDS CEASEFIRE AND POLITICAL DIALOGUE FROM OUR
DICTIONARY."  KHALAF IMPLICATED REST OF ARAB WORLD AS WELL:
"IF TELL ZAATAR FALLS, MANY ARAB REGIMES WILL FALL AS WELL."
PALESTINIAN RELATIONS WITH ARABS, HE SAID, "WILL BE FUNCTION OF
THEIR POSITIONS ON THE CAMP."  KHALAF ALSO ACCUSES CH TC
EETT
SZFR.#CHA
RBEL KASSIS OF HAVING ACCEPTED DIRECT MILITARY AID
FROM ISRAEL, BUT SAYS PHALANGISTS HAVE TRIED AVOID THIS.
PALESTINIANS REPORTEDLY HAVE KNOWN FOR SOME TIME THAT
RIGHTISTS RECEIVING ISRAELI MILITARY SUPPORT, BUT PUBLIC
STATEMENTS ON TOPIC HAVE BEEN AVOIDED UNTIL THIS PAST WEEK.
PALESTINIANS SEEM TO BE SUGGESTING POINT OF NO RETURN HAS BEEN
REACHED ON COOPERATING WITH LEBANESE RIGHT.  WAFA REPORTS YASSIR
ARAFAT ARRIVED BEIRUT 0300 JULY 4 LOCAL, BUT WE HAVE NO
CONFIRMATION.
6.  ON CHRISTIAN SIDE, HARDENED ATTITUDES ARE ALSO SURFACING.
CHAMOUN MADE STATEMENT JULY 3 SAYING FRANGIE OUGHT NOT
RESIGN BEFORE END OF HIS TERM AS PREMATURE DEPARTURE WOULD
EXPOSE THE HIGHEST OFFICE TO ATTACK.  STATEMENT IS MOST
STRAIGHFORWARD CHAMOUN INDICATION TO DATE THAT HE PUTS NO
STOCK IN SARKIS AND ROUND TABLE.  PIERRE GEMAYEL ISSUED
JULY 3 DECLARATION WITH HIS OLD IDEA THAT PALESTINIANS OUGHT TO
BE DIVIDED AMONG ARAB STATES NOW THAT THEY HAVE DEVIATED FROM
THEIR NATIONAL OBJECTIVES.  GUARDIANS OF THE CEDAR STATED FLATLY
THAT CAIRO ACCORDS ON PALESTINIAN STATUS NOT ACCEPTABLE AS
CEASEFIRE CONDITION SINCE THEY CONSTITUTE ONLY "PARTIAL
SOLUTION" OF PROBLEM.
7.  ON OTHER SIDE OF TOWN, JUMBLATT REPORTED TO HAVE TOLD
AL SECGEN MAHMOUD RIAD THAT PALESTINIANS AND LEBANESE
"NATIONAL MOVEMENT" WILL NOT SIT AT ROUND TABLE SO LONG AS
SINGLE SYRIAN SOLDIER REMAINS IN LEBANON.  SAEB SALAM ISSUED
STATEMENT ACCUSING FRANGIE OF DEALING WITH AL IN DUAL ROLES
AS BOTH CHIEF OF STATE AND LEADER OF "FRONT OF KFOUR."
8.  GERMAN-SPONSORED CONVOY OF SOME 80 VEHICLES LEFT BEIRUT
EAROY JULY 4 FOR DAMASCUS.  INCLUDED AMONG 280 PASSENGERS,
MAILY FOREIGNERS, WERE 30 AMCITS AND DEPENDENTS AND 29
AID/AUB PARTICIPANTS, INTENDING ONWARD TRAVEL TO HOME STATES
FROM DAMASCUS.  SOME 90 AID/AUB STUDENTS REMAIN IN
BEIRUT.  EMBASSY HAS TAKEN POSITION OF URGING THEM TO LEAVE

AIRPORT PRAISED THE FEAT BUT HELD TEL AVIV RESPONSIBLE
FOR VIOLATION OF UGANDAN SOVEREIGNTY. END SUMMARY.
1. INDIAN PRESS COMMENT ON THE ISRAELI RAID AT ENTEBBE
AIRPORT TERMED THE ISRAELI OPERATION "EXTRAORDINARY...
FANTASTIC... SPECTACULAR" (INDIAN EXPRESS); "A
MOST NOTABLE FEAT OF ARMS" (STATESMAN), AND "BRILLIANT"
(TIMES OF INDIA). SOME COMMENTATORS CRITICIZED THE OPERATION
AS "WANTON" (CONGRESS-ORIENTED NATIONAL HERALD) AND
"UNCIVILIZED" (MOSCOW-LINING PATRIOT).
2. EDITORIAL WRITERS UNIFORMALY CONDEMNED THE ISRAELI
ACTION AS A VIOLATION OF UGANDAN SOVEREIGNTY. THE INDIAN EXPRESS
JUDGED THAT IT "AMOUNTS TO TERRORISM OF A KIND THAT IS
NO DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF THE SKYJACKERS ACTING IN SMALL
GROUPS..." THE NATIONAL HERALD OBSERVED THAT THE POLICY OF "AN
EYE FOR AN EYE IS PART OF THE ZIONIST TRADITION
AND ISRAEL SEEMS TO BE DETERMINED TO SETTLE EVERY INTER-
NATIONAL ISSUE WHICH CONCERNS HER BY THE USE OF FORCE."
THE PATRIOT WARNED THAT TO LET ISRAEL "GO UNPUNISHED FOR
BRAZEN AGGRESSION, VIOLATION OF UGANDA'S SOVEREIGNTY AND
KILLING OF ITS SOLDIERS WOULD BE TO GIVE THE
ZIONIST STATE ENCOURAGEMENT IN ITS HORRIBLE CARRER OF TERRORISM AND
VIOLENCE."SAXBE

6 WITH MATTHEWS AND BLACKEN, FONMIN WILLS SAID HE UNDERSTOOD THAT
UGANDA WOULD BRING THE ISSUE OF ISRAELI INTERVENTION IN UGANDA
BEFORE THE UNSC.  WILLS SAID THAT WHILE HIS GOVT CONDEMNED TERROR-

AGAINST THE ISRAELI QUOTE INVASION UNQUOTE OF UGANDAN TERRITORY.
REGARDLESS OF CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH INTERVENTIONS COULD NOT BE
CONDONED.  APART FROM THE INTERNATIONAL ASPECTS OF THE MATTER,
HE SAID, DOMESTIC POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS MADE IT NECESSARY FOR
GUYANA TO PUBLICLY OPPOSE THE ISRAELI ACTION IN UGANDA.  CLEARLY
HE WAS THINKING OF THE PRECEDENT THAT MIGHT BE SET FOR VENEZUELAN
INCURSIONS INTO GUYANESE TERRITORY.
2.  WILLS ALSO SAID HE BELIEVED THAT POLITICAL PRESSURES IN THE
U.S. WOULD INDUCE THE USG TO OPPOSE A CONDEMNATION OF THE ISRAELI

FOR UN AFFAIRS, FERRABOSCHI, THIS MORNING. FERRABOSCHI SAID
MFA IS WATCHING CAREFULLY TO SEE IF AMIN IN FACT INTENDS TO
TAKE HIS CASE TO SECURITY COUNCIL, BUT HAS NO INDICATIONS
TO DATE THAT SUCH ACTION IS UNDERWAY. FOR THAT REASON, AND
BECAUSE THERE ARE DIFFERING VIEWS WITHIN THE MFA, FERRABOSCHI
SAID THERE IS NOT YET AN OFFICIAL GOI POSITION ON A
POSSIBLE AMIN INITIATIVE. HE ALSO AVOIDED SPECULATING
ON WHAT THE GOI STANCE WOULD BE IN THE EVENT.
2. COMMENT: WITHOUT NAMING FACTIONS, FERRABOSCHI SAID
THERE ARE THOSE IN THE MINISTRY ARGUING THE ILLEGALITY OF
THE ISRAELI MOVE, WITH OTHERS MAKING THE CASE FOR HUMANI-
TARIAN NEED. WHILE FERRABOSCHI, WITH PERHAPS EXCESSIVE
PRUDENCE, DECLINED TO PREDICT ITALIAN SUPPORT FOR THE US
VIEW, WE HAVE LITTLE DOUBT THAT GOI WILL RESPOND FAVORABLY
AND RAPIDLY IF THE PROBLEM MATERIALIZES, ALWAYS PROVIDING
OF COURSE THAT THE OTHER EC EIGHT ARE OF THE SAME GENERAL
VIEW.VOLPE

1.  WE PROVIDED MFA DIRECTOR OF POLITICAL AFFAIRS
LEIFLAND WITH EVIDENCE OF UGANDAN ASSISTANCE TO
HIJACKERS CONTAINED IN REF A.  AFTER READING MATERIAL,
LEIFLAND DESCRIBED IT AS "QUITE GOOD", AND SAID IT
WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR MEETING MFA HAS SCHEDULED FOR
EARLY THIS MORNING TO DETERMINE POSITION GOS WILL TAKE
AT JULY 8 UNSC CONSIDERATION OF ISRAELI RESCUE
OPERATION.
2.  CONTINUING, LEIFLAND SAID THAT HE ANTICIPATED
THAT THERE WOULD BE A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF
"INFLIGHTING" WITHIN GOS RE POSITION IT WILL TAKE ON
ISSUE.  FOR THIS REASON, HE ADDED, IT IS IMPORTANT
THAT FACT HE HAD REQUESTED INFORMATION ON UGANDA'S ROLE
FROM USG NOT RPT NOT LEAK OUT.  WE ASSURED HIM THAT IT
WOULD NOT FROM OUR SIDE.
3.  COMMENT:  AS LEIFLAND HAS INDICATED, UNSC
CONSIDERATION OF ISRAELI RESCUE OPERATION WILL UNDOUBTEDLY
CAUSE CONFLICT WITHIN GOS BETWEEN THOSE OFFICIALS MOST
CONCERNED ABOUT TERRORISM AND THOSE WHOSE CHIEF
INTEREST LIES IN PRESERVING GOOD RELATIONS WITH ARAB
AND AFRICAN NATIONS.  IN HIS CONVERSATION WITH US,
LEIFLAND HAS MADE IT CLEAR THAT HE BELIEVES MOST
IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION IS THAT HOSTAGES ESCAPED
UNHARMED, AND STATEMENT ON OPERATION ISSUED BY SWEDISH
GOVERNMENT (OF WHICH LEIFLAND WAS PRINCIPLE AUTHOR)
REFLECTED THIS VIEW (REF C).  HOWEVER, IT IS
UNCERTAIN WHETHER HIS VIEWS WILL PREVAIL WITHIN GOS
COUNCILS.  BASED ON PAST PERFORMANCE, IT IS
POSSIBLE THAT SWEDES WILL WORK FOR CONCENSUS
RESOLUTION, AND, FAILING THAT, OPT FOR ABSTENTION
WHEN THE CRUNCH COMES.
4.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO PURSUE MATTER WITH LEIFLAND.  IN
THIS CONNECTION, WE WOULD WELCOME THE ADDITIONAL

TEL AVIV | MEETING WITH SAEB SALAM
1.  SUMMARY: SAEB SALAM'S EXPRESSION OF SORROW RE MURDER OF
MELOY AND WARING GAVE ME OPENING TO URGE THAT HE USE HIS INFLUENCE TO
SEE THAT MURDERS ARE BROUGHT TO JUSTICE.  SALAM PLACED MUCH OF BLAME
FOR CURRENT LEBANESE SITUATION ON SYRIANS, WHO HE CLAIMED HAD ALIENAT
ED
ALL LEBANESE MOSLEMS. HE ACCUSED SYRIA AND U.S. OF MANIPULATING
SARKIS ELECTION AS PRESIDENT AND CONTENDED THAT SARKIS (IN CONTRAST
TO RAYMOND EDDE) HAS NO POLITICAL FOLLOWING. IN ADDITION, HE CLAIMED
SARKIS IS SURROUNDED BY CORRUPT INDIVIDUALS.  NEVERTHELESS, SINCE HE
HAS BEEN PICKED, ALL LEBANESE SHOULD LINE UP BEHIND HIM.
SALAM WELCOMED CONCEPT OF ROUNDTABLE CONFERENCE, BUT SAID
CEASEFIRE MUST COME FIRST. EGYPT'S STAR IN ARAB WORLD, HE
BELIEVED, HAS NOW RISEN AT SYRIA'S EXPENSE.  END SUMMARY.
2.  IN PROCEEDING TO MY MEETING JULY 1 WITH SAEB SALAM, FORMER
PRIME MINISTER, THERE WAS MUCH MORE NORMAL ACTIVITY ALONG THE
ROUTE THAN THE DAY I CALLED ON PRIME MINISTER KARAME (JUNE 29).
IN THE LATTER INSTANCE THE ROADS WE PASSED THROUGH WERE ALMOST
DESERTED--THE BATTLES OF TELL ZAATAR AND JISR AL-BASHA WERE AT
THEIR HEIGHT. YESTERDAY, PEOPLE WERE WALKING THE SIDEWALKS, AND
MAKESHIFT SHOPS LINED THE SEASIDE CORNICHE.
3.  MY MEETING WITH SAEB SALAM JULY 1, WHICH LASTED TWO HOURS
(HALF HOUR LONGER THAN THE MEETING WITH KARAME), BEGAN WITH HIS
EXPRESSING HIS SORROW ON DEATH OF AMBASSADOR MELOY AND BOB
WARING. HE ASKED IF WE KNEW WHO HAD COMMITTED THE MURDERS. I
REPLIED IN THE NEGATIVE AND SAID IT WOULD BE USEFUL IF HE COULD HELP
US TO GET MORE INFORMATION. HE AGREED IMMEDIATELY TO RAISE THE
QUESTION WITH THE PEOPLE CARRYING OUT THE INVESTIGATION (I.E.
PALESTINIANS). I ADDED THAT WE WOULD EXPECT IN SUCH A CASE FOR THE
QRIMINALS TO BE TRIED AND PENALTY OF DEATH IMPOSED. HE SAID MOST
IMPORTANT THING IS TO FIND OUT WHY THEY DID IT AND WHO ORDERED THE
MEN TO DO IT. HE ADDED THAT HE THOUGHT PALESTINIANS CARRYING OUT
THE INVESTIGATION HAD NOT YET FOUND THE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY DID THE
KILLING.
3.  I EXPLAINED TO SALAM THE FRAME OF REFERENCE FOR MY PRESENCE
IN LEBANON AND STRESSED THAT I HAD NO ANSWER TO LEBANON'S
PROBLEMS. I WAS, HOWEVER, PREPARED TO BE HELPFUL IF THERE WAS
ANYTHING THE U.S. COULD USEFULLY DO. I INTENDED TO KEEP A RELATIVELY
LOW PROFILE. AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, I WANTED TO BE IN TOUCH WITH THE
CHRISTIANS ON THE OTHER SIDE. SALAM AGREED THAT I SHOULD DO SO
WHENEVER I COULD.
4.  I STRESSED THAT THE U.S. VIGOROUSLY OPPOSES PARTITION OF
LEBANON, DESPITE RUMORS TO CONTRARY CIRCULATING IN MOSLEM
QUARTERS. ALSO, U.S. DOES NOT CONDONE MILITARY INTERVENTION IN
LEBANON, DESPITE CONTRARY REPORTS. WHEN SALAM INDICATED THAT
THERE SEEMED TO BE SOME TRUTH TO POPULAR BELIEF OF EXISTENCE OF A
CONSPIRACY BETWEEN SYRIA, U.S., ISRAEL AND L
C EN CHRISTIANS,
I RESPONDED THAT THIS IS UNTRUE. FURTHERMORE, U.S. SUPPORTS NO FACTIO
N
IN LEBANON AND WANTS ONLY TO SEE PEACE AND STABILITY RESTORED TO
AN INDEPENDENT LEBANON IN FRAMEWORK OF UNITY AND COHESION.
5.  SALAM SAID HE WAS PREPARED TO ACCEPT FACT THAT U.S. DOES NOT
FAVOR PARTITION OF LEBANON BUT, FRANKLY, HE COULD NOT HELP BUT FEEL
THAT SYRIA WOULD NOT HAVE ACTED AS IT DID WITHOUT U.S. ENDORSEMENT
PLUS CLOSE COORDINATION WITH ISRAEL. THERE IS BOUND TO BE SUSPICION
OF U.S. MOTIVES AND ACTIONS IN VIEW OF LONG-ESTABLISHED AND STRONG
U.S. SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL. THIS IS WHY, HE CONTINUED, SOVIET
AMBASSADOR TODAY IN LEBANON IS FETED EVEN THOUGH LEBANESE DO NOT
LIKE COMMUNITOU HE ALLUDED TO "INCAPABILITY" OF USG TO INTRODUCE
TROOPS INTO LEBANON, AND SAID THIS IS GOOD THING. I AGREED USG WOULD
NOT MILITARILY INTERVENE IN LEBANON, BUT STATED THAT REASON FOR THIS
IS THAT SUCH A MOVE WOULD HURT U.S. INTERESTS ALL OVER ARAB WORLD.
6.  SALAM WAS HIGHLY CRITICAL OF THE SYRIANS. HE DEPLORED THEIR
BEHAVIOR IN LEBANON AND BLAMED THEM IN LARGE MEASURE FOR PRESENT
STATE OF AFFAIRS. HE SAID THE SYRIANS BEAR A GREAT DEAL OF
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE EROSION OF SITUATION IN LEBANON BECAUSE THEY
HAD FIRST TRIED TO USE SAIQA AS THEIR INSTRUMENT IN LEBANON. THIS'
HAD ANTAGONIZED LEBANESE, PARTICULARLY SINCE SAIQA MISBEHAVED,
LOOTING ALMOST EVERYTHING IN SIGHT. SYRIANS HAD THOUGHT NAIVELY
THAT SOMEHOW SAIQA COULD PRESERVE SYRIA'S INTERESTS IN LEBANON,
BUT SAIQA WAS SOUNDLY DEFEATED. NOW THE SYRIANS HAD MADE EVERY
MOSLEM AN ENEMY AND THEY SHOULD LEAVE LEBANON. SALAM SAID U.S.
MUST BE HAPPY TO SEE THE ARABS IN DISARRAY BECAUSE THIS WEAKENS
THE ARABS. I RESPONDED THAT THIS IS ALSO UNTRUE AND, IF IT WOULD BE
HELPFUL, I WOULD BE SAYING AS MUCH TO THE PRESS. SALAM SAID THAT
ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS. AMONG OTHER THINGS, I OBSERVED,
ARAB DISARRAY IMPEDED ARAB-ISRAELI PEACE NEGOTIATIONS, TO WHICH
WE ATTACH THE GREATEST IMPORTANCE.
7.  SALAM NOTED THAT THE CONSPIRACY THEORY HAD BEEN PROPOUNDED
PUBLICLY BY RAYMOND EDDE FOR THE PAST YEAR AND A HALF. HE ACCUSED
US OF HAVING THEREFORE BEEN ANTI-EDDE IN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.
LAMBRAKIS, WHO WAS ALSO PRESENT, AND I DENIED U.S. HAD TAKEN ANY
POSITION IN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.  I SAID THAT WE HAD NO OBJECTI
ON
TO RAYMOND EDDE, EVENTHOUGH HE IS PRONE TO MAKE IRRESPONSIBLE
AND INACCURATE ALLEGATIONS. SALAM INSISTED THAT MOST LEBANESE
BELIEVED THAT U.S. AS WELL AS SYRIANS HAD BACKED SARKIS.  OTHERWISE,
EDDE WOULD HAVE BEEN ELECTED.  HE WAS UNABLE TO EXPLAIN HOW THIS
COULD BE THE CASE IF AT THE SAME TIME LEBANESE HAD LOSS OF
CONFIDENCE IN USG POLICY.
8.  IF EDDE HAD BECOME PRESIDENT, SALAM CONTINUED, HE WOULD HAVE
BEEN ABLE TO DRAW 90 PER CENT OF MARONITE SUPPORT AWAY FROM
TRADITIONAL EXTREMISTS SUCH AS GEMAYEL, CHAMOUN AND FRANGIE.
SARKIS, ON OTHER HAND, HAS NO POLITICAL FOLLOWING.  HE SAID EDDE
ACTUALLY POSSESSED A MAJORITY OF THE VOTES, AND PROBABLY WOULD HAVE
BEEN ELECTED PRESIDENT IN MARCH WHEN PARLIAMENT PRESENTED FRANGIE
WITH A PETITION FOR HIS RESIGNATWON SIGNED BY 66 DEPUTIES.  SALAM
PROFESSED TO KNOW FOR A FACT THAT FRANGIE WAS PREPARED TO RESIGN
THAT MORNING, BUT CHANGED HIS MIND AFTER HE GOT A TELEPHONE CALL
FROM PRESIDENT ASSAD IN DAMASCUS. THIS, HE STATED, WAS ANOTHER
INSTANCE OF SYRIAN RESPONSIBILITY FOR LEBANON'S PROBLEMS.  SALAM
WENT ON TO SAY THAT HE IS CONVINCED THAT SYRIA HAS DESIGNS ON THE
BEKAA.  HE ALLEGED THAT SYRIA IS NOW IN THE PROCESS OF INTEGRATING
THE SCHOOL SYSTEM THERE INTO THE SYRIAN SCHOOL SYSTEM.
9.  SALAM REITERATED HIS VIEW THAT SARKIS WAS ELECTED BY SYRIAN
BACKING.  BEISDES NOT HAVING POLITICAL SUPPORT AMONG THE MARONITES,
SARKIS HAS SURROUNDED HIMSELF WITH CHEHABISTS AND A GROUP OF
CORRUPT PEOPLE, MANY OF WHOM HAVE BEEN AROUND FRANGIE (SUCH AS
SHEIKH BUTROS KHOURY).  NEVERTHELESS, NOW THAT HE IS PRESIDENT,
CONTINUED SALAM, THERE IS NO CHOICE BUT TO LINE UP BEHIND SARKIS
AND TRY TO HELP HIM.
10.  SALAM SAID IT WAS A GREAT MISTAKE TO REFER TO CHRISTIAN
AND MOSLEM FACTIONS, RESPECTIVELY, AS "RIGHTISTS" AND "LEFTISTS."
MAJORITY OF MOSLEMS ARE NOT TO THE LEFT POLITICALLY.  LEBANESE DO
NOT LIKE OR WANT COMMUNISM.
11.  WHILE ACKNOWLEDGING EXISTENCE OF A PALESTINIAN PROBLEM IN
LEBANON, AS WELL AS CONFESSIONAL CONFLICT, SALAM REVERTED TO THEME
THAT NEFARIOUS OUTSIDE INFLUENCES, CHIEFLY THE SYRIANS, WERE PRIMARIL
Y
RESPONSIBLE FOR STIRRING THINGS UP. HE NOTED THAT THE PROPOSAL TO
HOLD A ROUNDTABLE CONFERENCE HAD BEEN ONE OF HIS EARLIEST IDEAS
WHEN SOME OONTHS AGO HE HAD ACTIVATED THE FORMATION OF THE DIALOGUE
COMMITTEE.  HOWEVER, DIALOGUE COMMITTEE, WHICH SHOULD HAVE BEEN
LIMITED TO FEW KEY INDIVIDUALS, HAD BEEN CONSTITUTED WITH TOO MANY
REPRESENTATIVES FROM JUMBLATT'S LEFTIST PARTIES, FOR EXAMPLE, AND
HAD NEVER GOTTEN GOING.  BY THE SAME TOKEN, HE WONDERED IF A
ROUNDTABLE CONFERENCE WERE POSSIBLE AT THIS TIME WHILE FIGHTING
CONTINUED.  A CEASEFIRE OUGHT TO BE THE FIRST STEP.
12.  SALAM NOTED THAT EGYPT HAS NOW ONCE AGAIN BECOME POPULAR IN
ARAB WORLD AT SYRIA'S EXPENSE. ARABS ARE NOW SAYING THAT AT LEAST
SADAT HAS BEEN DIRECT AND ABOVEBOARD IN AGREEMENTS HE NEGOTIATED
WITH ISRAEL RE SINAI. ASSAD, ON OTHER HAND, IS CONSIDERED
UNDERHANDED AND DEVIOUS. EGYPT HAS BENEFITED BY BECOMING
CH TWVON#OF PALESTINIANS.
13.  SAEB SALAM'S REMARKS ON TOPICS OF MORE CURRENT INTEREST
WERE REPORTED IN BEIRUT 5755.
14.  COMMENT: SAEB SALAM REMAINS AN INTERESTING AND CHARMING
PERSON TO TALK TO. THOUGH SEPTUAGENARIAN AND VOLUBLE, HE KEEPS UP
WITH THE TIMES REASONABLY WELL. MANY OF HIS INTERPRETATIONS OF
EVENTS FIT INTO A GENERAL PATTERN WHICH IS SHARED BY MARONITE LEADERS
SUCH AS RAYMOND EDDE AND RIVAL MOSLEM TRAIDITONALISTS SUCH AS
KARAME.  HE CONSIDERS JUMBLATT A CONSERVATIVE LIKE HIMSELF, THOUGH
ONE WHO IS PLAYING A DANGEROUS GAME WITH THE LEFT.  HE SEEMS TO HAVE
THE SAME FAITH KARAME EXPRESSED TO ME A FEW DAYS AGO THAT THE
LEBANESE CAN SETTLE THEIR DIFFERENCES REASONABLY WELL IF ONLY
OUTSIDERS--PARTICULARLY THE SYRIANS--WILL PERMIT THEM TO DO SO.
ALTHOUGH NOT ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT IN A TIME OF ARMED WARFARE, HE
REMAINS AN INFLUENTIAL POLITICIAN BEHIND THE SCENES AT LEAST UNTIL
SUCH TIME AS THE YOUNGER GENERATION PRODUCES POLITICIANS OF NOTE
RATHER THAN JUST FIGHTERS.

 * 23624 1976BEIRUT05953 0.007068642 | 1976-07-07 | BEIRUT | STATE | LEBANESE SITUATION JULY 7: PALESTINIAN OFFENSIVE IN NORTH FALTERS;  ARAB LEAGUE MEDIATION EFFORT REVIVES
1. SUMMARY: PALESTINIAN DRIVE IN NORTH IS FALTERING AND
CHRISTIANS HOPE EXPAND EARLIER ESTABLISHED AREAS OF CONTROL
IN COUNTEROFFENSIVE. TELL ZAATAR MOP-UP CONTINUESUK FIGHTING
ELSEWHERE IN BEIRUT AND IN REST OF COUNTRY CONTINUES AT HIGH
LEVEL, BUT INDECISIVE. INTER-ARAB MEDIATION EFFORTS REVIVE,
WITH SECOND SOFAR MEETING SCHEDULED FOR JULY 7 TO INCLUDE MOST
MAJOR PARTIES TO CONFLICT. BEIRUT AIRPORT RUNWAYS APPEAR TO
BE ONLY SLIGHTLY DAMAGED AND COULD HANDLE LARGE AIRCRAFT.
MINIMAL CITY WATER SUPPLY IN BEIRUT NOW COMPLETELY STOPPED AS
FUEL SHORTAGE WORSENS. SMALL BRITISH-ORGANIZED CONVOY DEPARTS
FOR DAMASCUS. END SUMMARY.
2. NORTH LEBANON HOLDS SPOTLIGHT AS RIGHTIST FORCES APPEAR TO
HAVE RETAKEN CHEKKA AND JOINT CHRISTIAN/SYRIAN COUNTER-THRUST
GAINS PREDOMINANCE. RIGHTIST ALSO CLAIM TO HAVE TAKEN AMYOUN
AND SEVERAL SURROUNDING VILLAES IN THE KOURA. LEFTISTS SAY
THEY HAVE REPELLED ALL ATTACKS AND CONTINUE TO CONTROL EVEN
CHEKKA, BUT MORE RELIABLE INFORMATION CONTRADICTS THIS CLAIM.
OTHER NORTHERN AREAS ARE VERY ACTIVE WITH UNUSUALLY HEAVY
ARTILLERY BARRAGES AT ZGHORTA NAD HALBA. WE UNDERSTAND
COMBINED RIGHTIST/SYRIAN FORCES MAY NOT INTEND TO STOP WITH
PRESENT SUCCESSES, BUT MAY CONTINUE MOVE NORTHWARD TOWARD
TRIPOLI.
3. TELL ZAATAR CONTINUES RECEIVE WIDE PRESS COVERAGE, ALTHOUGH
ACCORDING TO OUR INFORMATION, BATTLE IS LARGELY OVER. ARTILLERY
BARRAGES NEVERTHELESS CONTINUE IN VICINITY AT NABAA, DEKOUANEH,
AND SIN EL-FIL AND LARGE FIRES, APPARENTLY WOODS, BURN AT SABTYE,
DEKOUANE, MANSOURIEH, AND MKALLES. PRESS COMMENTS ON
INACCESSIBLE BATTLE FIELDS AND CONTRADICTORY COMMUNIQUES FROM
VARIOUS GROUPS REVEAL LACK OF GOOD FIRST-HAND KNOWLEDGE.
PALESTINIAN ACCUSATIONS THAT SYRIANS HELPED CHRISTIANS AT TELL
ZAATAR CONTINUE, AND WE UNDERSTAND SYRIANS POSSIBLY DID AT LEAST
ASSIST RIGHTIST FORCES'S PLANNING. HEAVY MUTUAL BOMBARDMENTS AT CHIYA
H/
AIN EL-RUMMANEH AND SOME GROUND ACTION CONTINUE. ARTILLERY
DUELS CONTINUE AS WELL IN HADETH/LAYLAKE AREA. BEIRUT CENTRAL
CITY AREA IS ACTIVE, INCLUDING SORTIES WITH HAND GRENADES AND
SMALL WEAPONS. SPORADIC BOMBARDMENTS OF RESIDENTIAL AREAS IN EAST
AND WEST SECTORS OF CAPITAL CONTINUE (INCLUDING RAS BEIRUT)
4. ELSEWHERE IN COUNTRY, MILITARY SITUATION REMAINS RELATIVELY
STABLE. HEAVY SYRIAN ARTILLERY BARRAGES JULY 6 HIT SIDON,
NEARBY VILLAGE OF ANKOUN AND PALESTINIAN CAMPS OF MYE MYE
AND AIN EL-HELOUE, AS WELL AS ZAHRANI REFINERY (SEE BELOW).
THIS WAS PERHAPS IN RETALIATION FOR PALESTINIAN AMBUSHES ON
SIDON/JEZZINE ROAD. BEKAA REMAINS STABLE ALTHOUGH TENSIONS
ARE HIGH AND AINTOURA/MTEIN AXIS MAY BE HEATING UP. SOME
SYRIAN SHELLING OF VILLAGES REPORTED FROM HERMEL AREA.
PALESTINIAN COMMAND IN SOUTH CLAIMS ISRAELI AIRCRAFT FLEW
OVER BORDER AREA AND IDF ARTILLERY FIRED AT VILLAGES OF
AITAROUN AND BLIDA.
5. MARATHON JULY 6 MEETING OF ARAFAT, JUNBLATT, AND LIBYAN
PREMIER JALLOUD APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN A TENSE ROUND ROBIN ON
MANY ISSUES. DESPITE MILITARY DETERIORATION IN THE NORTH,
SECOND MAJOR DIALOGUE SESSION EXPECTED AT SOFAR JULY 7.
JUNBLATT REFUSING TO ATTEND THIS SOFAR MEETING PERHAPS DUE
FEELING PALESTINIANS ARE STEALING SHOW. ARAFAT, JALLOUD, AL
SECGEN MAHMOUD RIAD, REPRESENTATIVES FO SYRIA AND THE MARONITE
"KFOUR FRONT" ALL SAY THE WILL ATTEND. GENERAL NAJI JAMIL WILL
REPRESENT SYRIAN AND KARIM PAKRADOUNI AND MICHEL SAMAHA THE
"KFOUR FRONT." MEETING TOPIC OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCED AS MILITARY
DEVELOPMENTS AT TELL ZAATAR, BUT PRESS SPECULATES DELEGATES
WILL DEAL MAINLY WITH SYRIAN/PALESTINIAN DIFFERENCES AND
ESTABLISHMENT OF AL-SPONSORED CEASEFIRE. CONFLICTING DEMANDS
MAKE ANY IMMEDIATE AGREEMENTS UNLIKELY. LEBANESE LEFTISTS
SAY THEY WILL CONTINUE FIGHT UNTIL SYRIANS WITHDRAW ENTIRELY
FROM LEBANON. RIGHTISTS CONTINUE INSIST ON CIARO ACCORDS AAD
RETURN OF PALESTINIANS TO CAMPS.
6. EMBRYONIC MOSLEM DISSATISFACTION WITH PALESTINIAN
DOMINANCE IN WEST BEIRUT IS PLAYED ON BY PIERRE GEMAYEL IN
JULY 6 CALL TO POLITICAL LEADERS OF WEST BEIRUT TO CLOSE RANSK
WITHOUT DELAY "TO LIBERATE THE LEBANESE FROM THE PALESTINIAN
PROGRESSIVE YOKE." HE SAID THAT KATAEB PARTY WILL CONTINUE
FIGHT UNTIL ALL LEBANESE REGIONS ARE LIBERATED. SYRIA,
ACTIVE MILITARILY, AVOIDS GETTING INVOLVED IN "BATTLE OF THE
AIR WAVES."
7. WE UNDERSTAND CHAMOUN ATTEMPTING FORCE ISSUE OF HIS
CONTESTED APPOINTMENT AS FOREIGN MINISTER (BY FRANGIE, WITHOUT
AGREEMENT OF PRIME MINISTER KARAME) BY SENDING INSTRUCTIONS TO
ALL LEBANESE AMBASSADORS TO APPROACH HOST GOVERNMENT TO EXPLAIN
LEBANESE SITUATION AND INSTRUCTION TO LEBANESE UN MISSION TO
SUPPORT SUDAN IN SUDAN-LIBYA QUARREL.
8. ICRC DC-6 CARRIED SIX TONS OF MEDICINES INTO BEIRUT
AIRPORT JULY 6, AND ANOTHER FLIGHT EXPECTED JULY 7. MINISTER OF
ECONOMY AND TRANSPORTATION ADEL OSSEIRAN SAYS REOPENING OF
AIRPORT NOT EVEN CONSIDERED FOR PRESENT DUE "ILLOGICAL CONDITIONS
IMPOSED BY THE KATAEB WAR COUNCIL." ICRC FLIGHT WAS FIRST SINCE
JUNE 27 WHEN MEA PLANE HIT ON RUNWAY BY CHRISTIAN ARTILLERY.
RELIABLE MEA SOURCE SAID JULY 6 RUNWAY SURFACES HAVE EIGHT
SMALL RUPTURES, BUT THAT BOEING 707 TYPE AIRCRAFT COULD LAND
AND TAKE OFF. CLOSURE CAUSING GREAT DIFFIKLTY ESPECIALLY IN
VIEW NEED TO IMPORT FOOD SUPPLIES AND INABILITY WESTERN ZONE
LEBANESE TO EASILY ENTER AND LEAVE COUNTRY.
9. BEIRUT WATER BUREAU SAYS IT CAN NO LONGER DELIVER EVEN SMALL
AMOUNTS OF WATER TO VARIOUS BEIRUT SECTORS, AS LACK OF FUEL HAS
CUT OFF ELECTRICITY TO DBAYE PUMPING STATION, WHICH DURING PAST
TWO WEEKS HAS BEEN SOLE REMAINING CITY WATER SOURCE, PUMPING
SMALL AMOUNTS TO VARIOUS CITY SECTORS ON RATOATION BASIS.
BEIRUTIS MUST NOW RELY ON INSUFFICIENT AND OFTEN BRACKISH WELLS.
SITUATION MAY HAVE TAKEN ADDITIONAL CRITICAL TURN WITH NEWS
THAT ZAHRANI REFINERY NEAR SIDON WAS BOMBARDED BY SYRIANS
JULY 6 AND IS NOW REPORED BURNING. FUEL FOR ZOUK ELECTRIC
STATION NORTH OF BEIRUT HAS BEEN ORDERED FROM RUMANIA, BUT
DELIVERY NOT SCHEDULED FOR SOME TEN DAYS.
10. BRITISH EMBASSY SPONSORED COMPARATIVELY SMALL CONVOY OF 25
VEHICLES TO DAMASCUS JULY 7. CONVOY CARRED 10 AMCITS, INCLUDING
ONE EMBASSY MEMBER.

 * 33753 1976BONN11368 0.007066171 | 1976-07-06 | BONN | STATE | FONMIN ALLON'S VISIT TO FRG, JUNE 23-25
1.  EMBOFF DISCUSSED ALLON VISIT WITH ECONMIN OFFICIAL.
ON THE SUBJECT OF INCREASING FRG OFFICIAL AID TO ISRAEL,
HE STATED THAT THE QUESTION OF AN INCREASE IN
TRADITIONAL FRG AID LEVELS COULD BE DISCUSSED WITH THE
ISRAELIS AT ANY TIME.  HE EMPHASIZED, HOWEVER, THAT HE
WAS NOT AWARE OF ANY FRG PROMISES TO BE FORTHCOMING
IN AID DISCUSSIONS AFTER OCTOBER 3.
2.  ECONMIN OFFICIAL CLAIMED THERE WERE IMPORTANT
REASONS WHY THE FRG COULD NOT SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE
OFFICIAL AID TO ISRAEL IN THE NEAR FUTURE.
(A) THE FRG AID MINISTRY BUDGET IS VERY TIGHT
AT THE MOMENT.  THE FRG IS ATTEMPTING TO HOLD DOWN
GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURES AND A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE
IN THE AID BUDGET IS NOT LIKELY IN THE NEAR TERM.
(B)  THE FRG ATTEMPTS TO BALANCE AID TO ISRAEL
WITH AID TO ARAB COUNTRIES.  THUS A SIGNIFICANT
INCREASE FOR ISRAEL WOULD ENTAIL INCREASES FOR THE
ARAB NATIONS AS WELL.
(C)  THE FRG ALSO ATTEMPTS TO BALANCE ITS AID
WORLDWIDE.  ISRAEL ALREADY RECEIVES A VERY HIGH
AMOUNT OF PER CAPITA AID AS COMPARED TO INDIA FOR EXAMPLE.
A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE FOR ISRAEL WOULD PORTEND
INCREASES IN WORLDWIDE FRG AID WHICH DOES NOT SEEM
POSSIBLE AT THIS TIME.
3.  THE FRG AND ISRAEL SIGNED THE TRADITIONAL DM 140
MILLION ECONOMIC AID AGREEMENT FOR 1976 ON JULY 1.  THE
FOREIGN MINISTRY ANNOUNCED THAT THIS AID IS INTENDED
FOR HOUSING CONSTRUCTION, TELEPHONE PROJECTS, AND
THE DEVELOPMENT BANK IN ISRAEL.
4.  ECONMIN OFFICIAL MAINTAINED THAT INCREASED DIRECT
PRIVATE FRG INVESTMENT IN ISRAEL AND INCREASED
ISRAELI EXPORTS TO THE FRG WOULD PROVIDE MORE BILATERAL
ASSISTANCE TO ISRAEL'S BATTERED ECONOMY THAN ANY
POSSIBLE INCREASE IN OFFICIAL FRG AID.  THE INVESTMENT
PROMOTION AGREEMENT SIGNED DURING ALLON'S VISIT WOULD
HELP IMPROVE THE INVESTMENT CLIMATE, BUT ISRAEL'S
DEVALUATION POLICIES ARE THE KEY TO INVESTOR
RELUCTANCE.  ONCE THE CYCLE OF DEVALUATION IS HALTED,
ISRAEL COULD EXPECT GERMAN INVESTORS TO RESPOND.  THE
FRG ALSO WOULD DO ALL IT COULD TO AID ISRAEL'S EXPORTS
WHICH WERE PRIMARILY HINDERED BY A LACK OF ISRAELI
EXPORT ORIENTATION.  THE CONTACTS MADE BY ALLON'S PARTY
WITH VARIOUS TRADE PROMOTION GROUPS IN THE FRG AND THE
VARIOUS BILATERAL MECHANISMS NOW ESTABLISHED (SUCH AS
THE ECONOMIC COMMISSION) WOULD HELP STIMULATE ISRAELI
EXPORTS TO THE FRG.

1. SUMMARY: AN 18-YEAR-OLD YOUTH WAS KILLED BY ISRAELI
SECURITY FORCES DURING CLASHES IN NABLUS JULY 2 ARISING OUT
OF PROTESTS AGAINST IMPOSITION OF EQUIVALENT OF VALUE
ADDED TAX (VAT) AND AGAINST SYRIAN ACTION IN LEBANON. CURFEW
IMPOSED FOLLOWING VIOLENCE WAS LIFTED AFTERNOON JULY 3.
STRIKES THAT BEGAN JULY 1 CONTINUED FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS
IN MOST WEST BANK TOWNS. END SUMMARY.
2.PROTESTS AGAINST EQUIVALENT OF VAT TO BE IMPOSED IN
WEST BANK AUGUST 1 DEVELOPED INTO ANTI-SYRIAN, PRO-PLO DEMON-
STRATIONS IN NABLUS JULY 2 IN WHICH ROCKS AND BOTTLES
WERE THROWN BY YOUTHFUL DEMONSTRATORS AT ISRAELI SECURITY
FORCES. SHOTS FIRED BY SECURITY FORCES RESULTED IN
DEATH OF 18-YEAR-OLD HASHEM SHANTIR. PRESS REPORTS 15
TO 20 OTHERS INJURED DURING VIOLENCE WHICH JERUSALEM POST
REPORTS INCLUDED ATTACK ON TAX OFFICE. CURFEW WAS IMPOSED
IN MOST PARTS OF NABLUS BUT LIFTED ABOUT 4:00 P.M. FOL-
LOWING DAY, AFTER SHANTIR'S FUNERAL. MAYOR BASSAM SHAK'A HAS
VIGOROUSLY DENIED RADIO REPORTS THAT VIOLENCE INCLUDED
MUSLIM-CHRISTIAN CLASHES.
3. MANY OTHER WEST BANK TOWNS WITNESSED CONTINUATION ON
JULY 2 AND 3 OF COMMERCIAL STRIKE BEGUN ON JULY 1. MOST
SHOPS IN EAST JERUSALEM REMAINED CLOSED JULY 2 BUT RE-
OPENED IN LARGE PART JULY 3, AT LEAST IN PART AS RESULT OF
POLICE PRESSURE. POLICE WERE SEEN JULY 3 MAKING NOTE OF
THOSE ESTABLISHMENTS STILL CLOSED IN EAST JERUSALEM BUSINESS

1. DURING COURSE OF JULY 6 MEETING WITH AMIR'S OFFICE DIRECTOR,
ISSA KAWARI, CHARGE TOOK OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS WITH HIM
PRESENT UNRWA FINANCIAL CRISIS AND REQUEST FOR SPECIAL UNRWA
CONTRIBUTION FROM GOQAM KAWARI SAID THAT GOQ HAD RECEIVED
CABLE FROM UNRWA REQUESTING ADDITIONAL FUNDS AND THAT MATTER
WOULD BE TAKEN UP DURING JULY 7 MEETING OF COUNCIL OF MINISTERS.
KAWARI ALSO SAID THAT QATAR WAS AWARE OF SAUDI SPECIAL CONTRIBUTION
OF TEN MILLION DOLLARS. CHARGE TOLD KAWARI THAT HE WAS PLEASED
TO HEAR THAT THIS UNRWA REQUEST WAS BEING CONSIDERED AND THEN
ASKED KAWARI IF HE HAD ANY IDEA OF AMOUNT THAT WOULD BE FORTH-
COMING. KAWARI SAID THAT HE DID NOT, BUT THAT HE WAS CERTAIN
THAT GOQ WOULD COME THROUGH WITH SPECIAL CONTRIBUTION. KAWARI
ENDED MEETING WITH PROMISE TO LET CHARGE KNOW AMOUNT OF CON-
TRIBUTION AS SOON AS MATTER ACTED ON BY COUNCIL OF MINISTERS AND
AMIR DECIDES ON AMOUNT OF CONTRIBUTION.
2. AFTER MEETING WITH KAWARI, CHARGE HAD OCCASION TO MEET
SEPARATELY WITH ANOTHER GOQ OFFICIAL WITH SOME RESPONSIBILITY
FOR UN AFFAIRS. HE ALSO CONFIRMED THAT UNRWA SPECIAL CONTRIBUTION
WILL BE ON AGENDA OF JULY 7 MEETING OF GOQ COUNCIL OF MINISTERS.
ALTHOUGH HE CLAIMED NOT TO KNOW AMOUNT OF CONTRIBUTION UNDER
CONSIDERATION, HE HINTED THAT AMOUNT MIGHT BE RELATIVELY GENEROUS.
HE SAID THAT SAUDI CONTRIBUTION OF TEN MILLION WAS INTENDED TO
PREVENT UNRWA FROM ENDING ITS ROLE IN WEST BANK AREA AND TO
PRECLUDE A TAKEOVER OF THESE UNRWA ACTIVITIES BY THE ISRAELIS;
THEREFORE, QATAR SHOULD FOLLOW THIS LINE.
3. ON MORNING JULY 7, CHARGE HAD OCCASION TO BRING UP AGAIN
UNRWA FINANCIAL CRISIS AND GOQ CONTRIBUTION WITH FONMIN OFFICIAL
IN CHARGE OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS. UNFORTUNATELY, THIS
PERSON WAS NOT VERY CURRENT ON SUBJECT AND HAD VERY LITTLE TO
OFFER. HE DID ADD, HOWEVER, THAT HE THOUGH QATAR WOULD EVENTUALLY
APPROVE AROUND ONE AND HALF TO TWO MILLION DOLLAR CONTRIBUTION.
4. WE WILL REPORT RESULTS OF COUNCIL OF MINISTERS MEETING IN
SEPTEL AND AS SOON AS KNOWN.
