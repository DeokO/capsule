In this section we develop the Capsule model.  Capsule captures patterns in entity behavior and identifies time intervals in which many entities deviate from these patterns.  The model relies on high dimensional entity behavior data over time, such as text messages being sent between entities.  We first review topic models at a high level, and give the intuition on Capsule. Then, we formally specify our model
%, discuss its relationship to Poisson processes, 
and describe how we learn the hidden variables.

\parhead{Background: Topic Models.} Capsule relies on topic models to model text data.  Topic models are algorithms for discovering the main themes in a large collection of documents; each document can then be summarized in terms of the global themes.  More formally, a topic $k$ is a probability distribution over the set of vocabulary words.  Each document $d$ is represented as a distribution over topics $\theta_d$.  Thus we can imagine that when we generate a document, we first pick which topics are relevant (and in what proportions).  Under the LDA topic model~\cite{Blei:2003}, we know the number of words in each document.  Then, for each word, we select a single topic from this distribution over topics, and finally select a vocabulary term from the corresponding topic's distribution over the vocabulary.  Alternatively, we can cast topic modeling as factorization, such as in Poisson factorization~\cite{Gopalan:2014b}, and draw a word count for each term in the vocabulary.

\parhead{The Capsule Model.}
Topic models are often applied to provide a structure for an otherwise unstructured collection of documents.  Documents, however, are often accompanied by metadata, such as the date written or author attribution; this information is not exploited by traditional topic models.  The Capsule model uses both author and date information to identify and characterize events that influence the content of the collection.


\begin{figure}

\caption{Cartoon intuition of Capsule.  The Bangkok embassy, Honk Kong embassy, and State Department all have typical concerns about which they usually send messages.  When an events occurs at time $t$, the stream of message content alters to include the event, then fades back to ``business as usual.''  Capsule discovers both entities' typical concerns and the event locations and content.}
\label{fig:cartoon}
\end{figure}

Consider an entity like the Bangkok American embassy, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:cartoon}.  We can imagine that there is a stream of messages (or \emph{diplomatic cables}) being sent by this embassy---some might be sent to the US State Department, others to another American embassy like Hong Kong.  An entity will usually talk about certain topics; the Bangkok embassy, for instance, is concerned with topics regarding southeast Asia more generally.

Now imagine that at a particular time $t$, an event occurs, such as the capture of Saigon during the Vietnam war.  We do not directly observe that events occur, but we do observe the message stream.  Using this stream, each event be described as a distribution over the vocabulary, similar to how topics are distributions over these same terms.  When an event occurs, the message content changes for multiple entities. The day following the capture of Saigon, the majority of the diplomatic cables sent by the Bangkok embassy were about Vietnam war refugees.
Thus we imagine that an entity's stream of messages is controlled by what it usually talks about as well as the higher level stream of unobserved events.

\parhead{Model Specification.}
We formally describe Capsule. The observed data are word counts $w_{d,v}$ for document $d$ and vocabulary term $v$; each document $d$ also has an author (or entity) $a_d$ and a time (or date) interval $i_d$ associated with it.

The hidden variables of this model are general topics of conversation $\beta$, authors' typical concerns $\phi$, event descriptions $\pi$, event strengths $\psi$, and document-specific topics $\theta$ and event relevancy $\epsilon$.  The graphical model in Figure~\ref{fig:graphicalmodel} shows considers dependencies between these latent parameters and the observed data.

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{fig/graphicalmodel.pdf}
\caption{A directed graphical model of Capsule to show considered dependencies. Shaded nodes $w$ are observed word counts.  Unshaded nodes are hidden variables---at the global level, these are topics $\beta$, entity typical concerns $\phi$, interval strength $\epsilon$, and interval content descriptions $\pi$.  At the document level, we have hidden variables for local entity concerns $\theta$ and interval relevancy $\epsilon$. Plates denote replication: there are $D$ documents, $T$ intervals, $N$ entities, $K$ topics, and $V$ vocabulary terms. Fixed hyperparameters are indicated by black squares.}
\label{fig:graphicalmodel}
\end{figure}

As in topic modeling, we represent the topics of conversation with a $K\times V$ matrix $\beta$, where $K$ is a low dimensional number of topics that we wish to capture, and $V$ is the size of our vocabulary; each row $\beta_k$ is normalized such that it represents the probability of seeing vocabulary word $v$ when discussing topic $k$.  As a generative process, we draw these general topics from a Dirichlet distribution, or $\beta_k \sim \mbox{Dirichlet}_V (\alpha_\beta).$ 

The concerns of author $n$ are represented with $\phi_n$, a $K$-dimensional topic vector, where each element is drawn from a gamma distribution, or $\phi_{n,k} \sim \mbox{Gamma}(s_\phi, r_\phi)$.\footnote{We use the shape-rate parameterization for all Gamma distributions.}  
Similar to topic modeling, we represent the contents of each document in topic space; each document $d$ has a $K$-dimensional latent parameter $\theta_d$ to describe the particular contents of that document.  Unlike traditional topic models, each document $d$'s topics depend on the concerns of the author $a_d$; each document topic $\theta_{d,k}$ is drawn from a gamma distribution parameterized by the corresponding author concerns $\phi_{a_d,k}$: $\theta_{d,k} \sim \mbox{Gamma}(s_\theta, \phi_{a_d,k})$.

To represent events, we consider discrete intervals of time.  Each interval $t$ has a corresponding interval strength $\psi_t$ and description $\pi_t$.  Event strengths are a single value for each interval $t$, and are drawn from a gamma distribution: $\psi_{n,k} \sim \mbox{Gamma}(s_\psi, r_\psi)$.  These strengths indicate how important the interval is in determining message content.  Interval descriptions are similar to topics: each description is a $V$-dimensional vector drawn from a Dirichlet distribution over the vocabulary terms, or $\pi_k \sim \mbox{Dirichlet}_V (\alpha_\pi).$

Just as we describe each document $d$ in terms of relevant topics with the $\theta_d$ parameters, we also describe the relevancy of each time interval with the $\epsilon_d$ parameters.  These interval relevancy parameters are drawn from gamma distributions and depend on the overall strength $\psi$ of the corresponding interval; for interval $t$ and document $d$ (written at time $i_d$), we have $\epsilon_{d,t} \sim \mbox{Gamma}(s_\epsilon, \psi_{i_d,t})$.

Conditional on the hidden variables and the author and time metadata, Capsule is a model of how document word counts came to be.  For document $d$ and vocabulary term $v$, we generate the word counts form a Poisson distribution parameterized by the documents topics $\theta_d$ and relevant events $\epsilon$, as well as global topic $\beta$ and event descriptions $\pi$:
\begin{equation}
w_{d,v} \sim \mbox{Poisson}\left(\theta_d^\top\beta_v + \sum_{t=1}^T f(i_d, t) \epsilon_{d,t} \pi_{t,v}\right),
\label{eq:generateData}
\end{equation}
where $f$ is some function of decay.  This function is important because events should not remain at their full strength indefinitely, but should decay over time.  In our experiments, we consider step functions, linear decay, and exponential decay.  Figure~\ref{fig:generative-model} gives the full generative process for Capsule.

\parhead{Learning the hidden variables.}
In order to use the Capsule model to explore the observed documents, we must compute the posterior distribution.  Conditional on the observed word counts $w$, our goals to to compute the posterior values of the hidden parameters---global interval strengths $\psi$, interval descriptions $\pi$, entity concerns $\phi$, and topics $\beta$, as well as document-specific entity concerns $\theta$ and interval relevancy parameters $\epsilon$.

As for many Bayesian models, the exact posterior for Capsule is not tractable to compute; approximating it is our central statistical and computational problem.  We develop an approximate inference algorithm for Capsule based on variational methods~\cite{Wainwright:2008}.\footnote{Source code will be released on github upon publication.}%is available at https://github.com/?????/capsule.} % ?????=ajbc on publication

Variational inference approaches the problem of posterior inference by minimizing the KL divergence from an approximating distribution $q$ to the true posterior $p$.
This is equivalent to maximizing the ELBO,
\begin{multline}
	\mathcal{L}(q)  = \E_{q(\psi, \pi, \phi, \beta, \theta, \epsilon)}\bigl[\log p(w, \psi, \pi, \phi, \beta, \theta, \epsilon) \\
	-~\log q(\psi, \pi, \phi, \beta, \theta, \epsilon)\bigr].
	\label{eq:elbo}
\end{multline}

We define the approximating distribution $q$ using the mean field assumption:
\begin{multline}
	q(\psi, \pi, \phi, \beta, \theta, \epsilon) = \prod_{t=1}^T \left[ q(\pi_{t} \g \lambda^\pi_t) q(\psi_t \g \lambda^\psi_t) \right] \\
		\prod_{k=1}^K \left[ q(\beta_{k} \g \lambda^\beta_k) \prod_{n=1}^N q(\phi_{n,k} \g \lambda^\phi_{n,k}) \right] \\
		\prod_{d=1}^D \left[
				\prod_{k=1}^K q(\theta_{d,k} \g \lambda^\theta_{d,k})
				\prod_{t=1}^T q(\epsilon_{d,t} \g \lambda^\epsilon_{d,t})
			\right]
	\label{eq:q}
\end{multline}

The variational distributions $q(\pi)$ and $q(\beta)$ are both Dirichlet-distributed with free variational parameters $\lambda^\pi$ and $\lambda^\beta$, respectively.  Similarly, $q(\psi)$, $q(\phi)$, $q(\theta)$ and $q(\epsilon)$ are all gamma-distributed with corresponding free variational parameters $\lambda^\psi$, $\lambda^\phi$, $\lambda^\theta$, and $\lambda^\epsilon$.

The expectations under $q$, which are needed to maximize the ELBO, have closed form analytic updates, as detailed in Appendix~\ref{sec:inference}. We update each parameter in turn, following standard coordinate ascent variational inference techniques.  Full details on our inference algorithm can be found in the appendix.  This algorithm produces a fitted variational distribution which can then be used as a proxy for the true posterior, allowing us to explore a collection of documents with Capsule.  


% \parhead{Visualization.}
% Capsule is a high-level statistical tool. In order to understand and explore its results, a user must scrutinize numerical distributions.
% To make Capsule more accessible, we developed an open source tool for visualizing its results.\footnote{Source code: https://github.com/?????/capsule-viz.}  Our tool creates a navigator of the documents and latent parameters, allowing users to explore events, entities, topics, and the original documents.  Figure~\ref{fig:viz} shows several screenshots of this browsing interface.
