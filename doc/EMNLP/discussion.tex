We have presented Capsule, a Bayesian model that identifies when events occur, characterizes these events, and discovers the typical concerns of author entities.  We have shown that Capsule outperforms deterministic baseline methods and explored its results on three real-world datasets.
We anticipate that Capsule and its visualization can be used by historians, political scientist, and others who wish to explore and investigate events in large text corpora.  
Future work includes expanding the model to incorporate messages recipients and allowing events to impact only a subset of entities.
