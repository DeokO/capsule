We presented Capsule, a Bayesian model for detecting and
characterizing potentially significant events. We evaluated Capsule's
ability to detect events and identify relevant messages; it outperformed four
baseline methods. We used Capsule to analyze a large corpus of U.S. State
Department cables from the 1970s, demonstrating
that it can discover both well-known and obscure (but
significant) events, as well as relevant documents. We anticipate that Capsule, and our
visualization tool, will be useful for historians, political
scientists, and journalists who wish to explore and understand large
corpora of documents. This is increasingly important---the U.S. State Department alone produces
around two billion e-mails annually.\looseness=-1
