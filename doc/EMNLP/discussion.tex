We presented Capsule, a Bayesian model for detecting and
characterizing potentially significant events. We evaluated Capsule's
ability to detect events by comparing its performance that that of
four baseline methods; Capsule outperformed all four. We used Capsule
to analyze a corpus of over two million U.S. State Department cables
from the 1970s, demonstrating that it can discover well-known events,
as well as events that are more obscure, but potentially
significant. We anticipate that Capsule, and our open-source
visualization tool, will be useful for historians, political
scientists, and journalists who wish to explore and understand large
corpora of documents.
