We presented Capsule, a Bayesian model for detecting and
characterizing potentially significant events. We evaluated Capsule's
ability to detect events and find relevant messages; it outperformed four 
baseline methods. We used Capsule to analyze a large corpus of U.S. State 
Department cables from the 1970s, demonstrating 
that it can discover both well-known and obscure (but 
significant) events, as well as relevant documents;
this is increasingly important---it
is estimated that the State Department 
produces two billion e-mails annually. 
We anticipate that Capsule, and our
visualization tool, will be useful for historians, political
scientists, and journalists who wish to explore and understand large
corpora of documents.
