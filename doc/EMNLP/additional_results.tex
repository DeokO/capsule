\subsection{Decay Functions}

We assessed Capsule's sensitivity to several decay
functions. We considered an exponential function,
\begin{align}
f(t_d, t) &=
\begin{cases}
    0			& t \leq t_d < t + \tau\\
    \exp{\left(\frac{-(t_d - t)}{\tau\,/\,5}\right)}          & \textrm{otherwise,}\footnotemark
\end{cases}
\label{eq:fexp}
\intertext{a linear function,}
f(t_d, t) &=
\begin{cases}
    1 - \frac{(t_d - t)}{\tau}			& t \leq t_d < t+\tau  \\
    0          & \textrm{otherwise,}
\end{cases}
\label{eq:flinear}
\intertext{and a step function,}
f(t_d, t) &=
\begin{cases}
    1			& t \leq t_d < t+\tau  \\
    0          & \textrm{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
\label{eq:fstep}
\end{align}
\footnotetext{Unlike the linear and step functions, the exponential
    function could be evaluated for any time interval $t$ after
    message $d$'s appearance at $t_d$; however, we truncate the
    function for computational reasons.  The mean lifetime of the
    exponential decay is $\tau$ divided by five, which ensures that
    99.3\% of the area under the curve has occurred before we truncate
    the function at $\tau$.}  For each decay function, we used
    Capsule's generative process, with $\tau = 3$, to create ten
    simulated data
    sets. We used three versions of our approximate inference
    algorithm---one for each decay function---to obtain a fitted
    variational distribution for each data set. We experimented with
    $\tau = 1, \ldots, 5$. \Cref{fig:sensitivity} shows event
    detection results (using \cref{eq:detection}) and message
    identification results (using precision at ten messages).

As expected, Capsule performs best when the decay function used in the
inference algorithm matches the decay function used to generate the
data. For both event detection and message identification, the
exponential function is least sensitive to the value of $\tau$ used to
generate the data and the value of $\tau$ used in the inference
algorithm. We also found that the exponential function gave the most
interpretable results for real messages.

and the value of $\tau$ used in the inference algorithm.}
