\label{tab:entities}
\end{table*}

\subsection{Decay Functions}

We assessed Capsule's sensitivity to several decay
functions. We considered an exponential function,
\begin{align}
f(t_d, t) &=
\begin{cases}
    0			& t \leq t_d < t + \tau\\
    \exp{\left(\frac{-(t_d - t)}{\tau\,/\,5}\right)}          & \textrm{otherwise,}\footnotemark
\end{cases}
\label{eq:fexp}
\intertext{a linear function,}
f(t_d, t) &=
\begin{cases}
    1 - \frac{(t_d - t)}{\tau}			& t \leq t_d < t+\tau  \\
    0          & \textrm{otherwise,}
\end{cases}
\label{eq:flinear}
\intertext{and a step function,}
f(t_d, t) &=
\begin{cases}
    1			& t \leq t_d < t+\tau  \\
    0          & \textrm{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
\label{eq:fstep}
\end{align}
\footnotetext{Unlike the linear and step functions, the exponential
    function could be evaluated for any time interval $t$ after
    message $d$'s appearance at $t_d$; however, we truncate the
    function for computational reasons.  The mean lifetime of the
    exponential decay is $\tau$ divided by five, which ensures that
    99.3\% of the area under the curve has occurred before we truncate
    the function at $\tau$.}  For each decay function, we used
    Capsule's generative process, with $\tau = 3$, to create ten
    simulated data
    sets. We used three versions of our approximate inference
    algorithm---one for each decay function---to obtain a fitted
    variational distribution for each data set. We experimented with
    $\tau = 1, \ldots, 5$. \Cref{fig:sensitivity} shows event
    detection results (using \cref{eq:detection}) and message
    identification results (using precision at ten messages).

As expected, Capsule performs best when the decay function used in the
inference algorithm matches the decay function used to generate the
data. For both event detection and message identification, the
exponential function is least sensitive to the value of $\tau$ used to
generate the data and the value of $\tau$ used in the inference
algorithm. We also found that the exponential function gave the most
interpretable results for real messages.

and the value of $\tau$ used in the inference algorithm.}

% % Appendix~\ref{sec:additional_results} contains additional examples of events discovered by Capsule, and more examples of general and entity-specific topics.

% \parhead{Events detected by Capsule.}
% In addition to the real-world events discussed in \Cref{sec:eval}, many other events were detected by Capsule.  For example, in 1973, the U.S. presented all nations with samples of rock obtained from the moon on the Apollo 17 mission.  Top cables under $\epsilon$ for this week include messages about receiving the sample shipments at the various embassies, such as a message sent by the Cairo embassy on July 2, 1973:
% \begin{shaded*} \tt{Lunar sample recieved June 30.  Will advise Department of our plans for presentation as soon as they are firm.}
% \end{shaded*}
% \noindent and a similar message from the Kuala Lumpur Embassy the same day:
% \begin{shaded*} \tt{Lunar sample and accompanying materials unreceived. Advise shipping data.}
% \end{shaded*}
% \noindent We also observe a cable sent by New Delhi the following day:
% \begin{shaded*} \tt{1. As Department aware, lunar sample for India was presented by Apollo 17 austronauts to Lok Sabha (Lower House of Parliment) Speaker G.S.~Dhillon on Jun 19.
% Captain Cernan's remarks on that occasion on which he was escorted by the Charge',
% were similar to those suggested Ref B.}

% \tt{2. Embassy has received lunar sample for Bhutan (Ref A) which will be presented to Bhutanese on some propitious future date.
% In making presentation, remarks suggested Ref B will be drawn upon as appropriate.}
% \end{shaded*}


% Another peak in \Cref{fig:cables_events} occurs the week of April 17, 1978 surrounding a UN special session on disarmament; the top three words under event its description $\pi$ are \emph{SSOD} (acronym for ``special session on disarmament'', \emph{disarmament}, and \emph{ICS} (likely an acronym for ``incident command system''); \Cref{tab:ssod} shows the top cables for this time interval, sorted by event relevancy $\epsilon$.  Most of these cables concern attendance, such as the first cable, which is from Bangkok:
% \begin{shaded*} \tt{
% Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs official in International Organizations Department told EmbOff Apr 19 that his Dept had recommended that Foriegn Minister Uppadit attend SSOD.
% Uppadit, however, had just arrived back from trip to Asean
% countries and had not yet considered composition of delegation.
% MFA official expected the Foreign Minister would not decided
% on his attendance until early May. Will advise.}

% Unfortunately, many interesting cables are withdrawn, meaning the main body of the message is unavailable.  An example of this is the cable sent on April 20, 1978 from the State Department to London with the subject \emph{SSOD: security assurances for non-nuclear states.}  The following description is provided by NARA for withdrawn cables such as these:
% \begin{shaded*}
% \emph{The Department of State created withdrawal cards for telegrams exempt from disclosure for reasons of national security, privacy, and other statutory concerns. The agency's withdrawal cards serve as placeholders for the records exempt from disclosure. NARA created withdrawal cards for an additional set of telegrams that require review under the Freedom of Information Act. The data elements potentially available for each withdrawal card include: concepts; date; document number; from; subject; traffic analysis by geography and subject; to; and microfilm roll number.}

% \end{table*}

% The return of the crown of St.~Stephen to Hungary was a contentious event, with many individuals sending in their opinions on it; \Cref{tab:crown} shows top cables for this event.

% In early October of 1977, the International Whaling commission (IWC) banned killing bowhead whales. Capsule detects this surge in discussion and the top cables recovered by Capsule indicate that the U.S. State department objected to this ban,\footnote{Their objections were based on Alaskan Natives rely on these whales for sustenance.} but that many individuals disagreed, resulting in the majority of the top cables having subjects along the lines of \emph{Requests State Dept not file objection to zero quota for bowhead whales}.

% Similar to the sequence of Sinai events, another sequence of events occurs surrounding opium production; in March 1974, Capsule detects that Turkey plans to lift a ban on growing opium poppy.  Two months later, the model detects another event when the U.S. makes a policy statement on the domestic production of opium poppy.  For the first event, the top three cables for this interval have subjects \emph{Turkey to resume cultivation of the opium poppy}, \emph{Cultivation of opium poppy in Turkey}, and \emph{Ban on opium cultivation in Turkey}. Another cable further down the list has the subject, \emph{US funds to Turkey to halt opium production}.  On March 12, 1975, the London embassy reports the the State Department:
% \begin{shaded*}
% \tt{1.  Pursuant to RefTel, we spoke to W.~N.~Hillier-Fry,
% head of Middle East and Mediterranean Department
% of Overseas Development Administration, who will
% head UK delegation to meeting of OECD consortium for
% Turkey.  Hillier-Fry said that, as in last meeting,
% he can support USG initiatives with regard to Turkish
% opium production, but he emphasized that he will have
% to take a very cautious approach and will pick his
% words carefully.  He added that he will be in touch
% with USG representatives at the meeting.}

% \tt{2.  As FCO department head
% in separate conversation March 11, UK representative
% will have to be careful in whatever he says not to
% imply any increase in British aid to Turkey, given
% straitened financial circumstances of hmg at present.
% Goodison also confirmed letter from him has gone to
% British ambassador in Ankara along lines indicated
% London's 2980.}
% \end{shaded*}
% \noindent Two days later, Kissinger sends a message to Ankara with the subject \emph{Opium ban: attitudes within GOT}:
% \begin{shaded*}
% \tt{In conversation with Sisco reported RefTel Esenbel referred
% to division within got on handling of opium problems.  At
% one point he identified Orhan Eyuboglu as leader of hard
% liners who wished immediate resumption of poppy cultivation.
% By implication he identified Fonmin Gunes and
% himself as members of those seeking cooperate with united
% states, e.g. Gunes ``very pleased'' with decision not to
% plant in April.}
% \end{shaded*}
% Eight weeks later, we see the second event with many messages on individuals writing on the subject of the \emph{US policy statement on domestic production of opium poppy}.  Again, Capsule cannot capture every aspect of larger sequences of events, but it can provide insight into key moments, as it does here.

% \parhead{arXiv event detection.}
% \Cref{fig:cables_events} shows a variety of events that Capsule detected from the National Archive diplomatic cables data, many of which were discussed in \Cref{sec:eval} and above.  To provide a negative example (Capsule not detecting events), we consider a collection of arXiv abstracts posted from 1995 through part of 2016.  As these scientific paper pre-print abstracts should not have event resolution on the order of weeks, we do not anticipate finding meaningful events in this corpus.

% \Cref{fig:arxiv_events} shows that Capsule does not detect events on this data, as anticipated.  Early in the time range, when there is little data, the measure of ``eventness'' fluctuates wildly.  The measure does produce a few peaks, but these are a result of over-fitting rather than the true detection of real-world events--the top abstracts at these time points do not a reveal a consistent theme.  This process of checking the top documents for each of the rare peaks is quick to perform.

% \parhead{Model Sensitivity.}  Using simulated data, we assessed the sensitivity of our model to different decay functions $f$ and decay durations $\tau$.  We simulated data following the description in \Cref{sec:eval}.  We considered an exponential decay function, shown in \Cref{eq:f}, as well as linear decay,
% \begin{equation}
% f(i_d, t) =
% \begin{cases}
%     1 - \frac{i_d - t}{\tau + 1},			& \text{if } t \le i_d < t+\tau  \\
%     0,          & \text{otherwise.}
% \end{cases}
% \label{eq:flinear}
% \end{equation}
% and a step function,
% \begin{equation}
% f(i_d, t) =
% \begin{cases}
%     1,			& \text{if } t \le i_d \le t+\tau  \\
%     0,          & \text{otherwise.}
% \end{cases}
% \label{eq:fstep}
% \end{equation}
% We simulated data with $\tau=3$ and simulated ten data sets for each of the three functions $f$.

% In fitting the models, we also considered all three functions $f$, but we also varied the decay duration $\tau$ from 1 to 5.  \Cref{fig:sensitivity} shows the results of these experiments, using both event detection and document recovery metrics discussed in \Cref{sec:eval}.

% \begin{figure*}[th]

% \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{fig/sim_sensitivity.pdf}
% \caption{Assessment of model parameter sensitivity on simulated data--exponential decay tends to perform the best for document recovery, but by a small margin.}
% \label{fig:sensitivity}
% \end{figure*}

% For event detection, the various decay functions perform roughly comparably.  For document recovery, the exponential function has mild advantages on all data types.  In exploring results on the real-world cable data, we found that the exponential decay provided the mos interpretable results.




% % We assessed the sensitivity of our model to three different decay functions $f$: exponential, linear, and step functions.  We simulated data for each function and then fit Capsule using every permutation of $f$ and multiple settings for event decay duration.  In all cases, we found that the model is not sensitive to decay shape or duration; details are in Appendix~\ref{sec:additional_results}.
