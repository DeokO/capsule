\PP outline two datasets (cables and enron) and the tasks to be done

\subsection{Data}
\parhead{Cables}

\parhead{arXiv}

\parhead{Enron}


\PP insert table and refetence for both (number of days, entities, total messages, or something); maybe a plot showing attributes of the data...somehow inform them that the state department is a bias for the cables data

\PP footnote on handling multiple recipients of message...

\subsection{Metrics and competing methods}

\PP how we evaluate based on real events

\PP how we evaluate based on perplexity (prediction of words)

\PP competing methods for perplexity: LDA, average user words?, dynamic topic model, network topic models

\subsection{Performance and exploration}

\PP sumry of comparison to gold-standard events for cables

\PP table of predictive likelihood results and summary pgh; and/or cite tea leaves paper

\parhead{Exploration}

\PP charachetrize events manually (based on cables) vs event detection characterization

\PP show descriptions for cables entities and select events; same for arxiv/enron

\PP any other exploration you can think of!


Results: ROC curve (x=false postive rate, y=true postive rate)
