\PP why are events interesting?

\PP what is an event?  (how do we characterize it)

\PP topic modeling + viz (incl dynamic topic models)

\PP network and related work there (e.g. hanna's work); say this isnt explicitly about netorks, but the data has this structure dn the model can be extended to use these concepts (do small experiment where ``entites'' are defined as to/from pairs)
