\PP idea of validation results

From Text as data:

Significant events are characterized by interactions between entities (e.g., countries, organizations, individuals) that deviate from typical interaction patterns.  Investigators, such as historians, commonly read large quantities of text to construct an accurate picture of who, what, when, and where and event happened.  In this work, we present methods for analyzing documents to identify and characterize events of potential significance.
Specifically, we develop a model based on topic modeling to distinguish between topics that describe ``business-as-usual'' and topics that deviate from these patterns, where deviations are also indicated by particular entities interacting during particular periods of time
To demonstrate this model, we analyze a corpus of over 2 million State Department cables from 1973 to 1977; we also use this corpus to demonstrate how Capsule (model name) can be used to enhance the exploration of a collection of semi-structured documents.
